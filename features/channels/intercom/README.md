You can now integrate your AI support agent directly into Intercom for a seamless AI experience with our Intercom app, [you can find it here in the Intercom app store](https://www.intercom.com/app-store/?app_package_code=my-askai-7tpd).

{% hint style="success" %}
The Intercom integration is available on all paid plans, [see pricing](https://myaskai.com/pricing).
{% endhint %}

### What are the benefits of using My AskAI within Intercom?

There are several reasons why you should use your My AskAI within Intercom:

* While Intercom has its own AI agent (called "Fin"), it is expensive, around 5-10x the price of My AskAI per conversation (we also think ours is smarter, but we'll let you be the judge!)
* You can add more knowledge to your AI agent in addition to your website and Intercom help center by using our [connections](../../connections/), live data or [file uploads](../../file-uploads.md).
* [There are several ways your CS team can use your AI agent within Intercom](./#how-can-i-use-my-ai-chatbot-within-intercom), so you can use whichever works for them ([read on below for more](./#how-can-i-use-my-ai-chatbot-within-intercom)).
* You don't have to add any code to your site to get your AI agent live, just connect our app and you're ready to go.
* Every AI answer is provided with "References" to the sources used to answer the question.
* As well as an AI agent, you get all our other features like [Improve](../../improve/), [Insights](../../insights/), [Email Assistant](../../email-assistant.md), [Site Search](../../site-search.md), [Private (Internal) mode](../../private-internal-mode.md), [Integrations with Slack](../) and more.&#x20;

### How to draft AI conversational replies to users, without sending them in Intercom

You can set the agent to automatically create AI note responses for you to use instead of replying directly to the user, to do this:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (113).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (388).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

3. That's it, now when someone talks with your Intercom you will see the AI response appear as a note you can use to help with your reply.

### How can I run a workflow after a human handover in Intercom?

To assign a ticket or conversation to a specific human agent on handover, [follow our guide here](human-handover-workflows.md).

### How can I stop draft notes from being generated for a conversation or email in Intercom?

To stop draft notes from being generated for a conversation, just add a note to the conversation with:

_`"Stop AI replies"`_

{% hint style="warning" %}
This must be written as a 'Note' and not a 'Reply'
{% endhint %}

### How does human handover work when using the Intercom messenger integration?

If, at any time, the user wishes to be passed over to a person to continue the conversation, all they need to do is say so, saying "Talk to a person" (or similar words to that effect).

Once the conversation is passed over to the human, the AI will not respond again until the agent hands back control to the AI.

When the AI agent cannot answer a question, it will also prompt the user to type "Talk to a person" to make it obvious they can speak to a person.

As part of the handover, the AI agent will summarize the conversation so the agent can pick up where the user left off so there is no repetition or frustration.

To trigger a workflow after a human handover has taken place, [follow these instructions](human-handover-workflows.md).

### Will the AI agent reply to emails within Intercom?

Yes, your AI agent can reply to emails received in Intercom. To turn this feature on or off:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Your account must have an authenticated email setup (you’re likely already using this if email replies are already coming from your domain)
{% endhint %}

1. Turn off any email auto-replies or reply workflows for email within Intercom (_**Settings > Channels > Email > Auto-replies**_)
2. Login to your My AskAI account
3. Go to _**Dashboard > Channels > Intercom > Email replies**_
4. Turn on email replies

{% hint style="info" %}
_Optional: Change the admin sender (Note: The AI email sender must be from a team member’s account can’t be the bot account used in Messenger. You can create an additional team seat for your AI agent or use one of your teams)_
{% endhint %}

### How can I take control from or give control to the AI agent in Intercom?

You can give control or take back control from the AI at any time, here's how:

#### To take control of a conversation

Just reply to any open conversation as an admin/agent and the conversation's control will be taken from the AI agent, note, this will not work for email replies. For email replies in Intercom you will need to add a note saying "Stop AI replies" to the ticket.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (115).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### To give control to the AI agent

1. Create a Macro (_Settings > Workspace> Macros (Saved replies)_) with the below message. The underlined text must be included. The remaining text can be customized. \
   \
   `"Hi there, I'll pass you`` `**`back to our AI assistant`**` ``for any further questions."`

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Untitled (15).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

2. Now, to use the Macro, just type CTRL+K in the reply field and then select "Use Macro" and click "Hand back control to AI assistant"

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (357).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### How can I add my agent as part of a triaged workflow in Intercom?

1. [Connect your agent to Intercom](./#how-to-connect-your-ai-chatbot-to-intercom)
2. Turn on the toggle switch for Workflow/Triage settings

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (389).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

3. Decide on a trigger phrase to use for your AI workflow handover button, type it into the field below the toggle switch and include this as the text in a button in your workflow (example workflow below for "Chat with AI assistant" as the trigger phrase)

{% hint style="danger" %}
This phrase must _**exactly**_ match the pre-defined button you are going to use in your workflow message.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Untitled (21).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

4. Turn off "Let customer type" in your initial welcome message workflow
5. Your AI agent will now only begin responding after the AI chat button has been pressed.

### How can I stop the AI agent from replying to specific phrases in Intercom?

To stop your AI agent from replying to a specific set of phrases in Intercom, [share with us a list of the phrases you would like to block via email](mailto:team@myaskai.com) and we will update your bot with these.

(Available on Pro accounts and above).

### How do I auto-close a ticket in Intercom after a set amount of time?

You can auto-close tickets in Intercom (that have not been transferred to a person) after a certain time period without a response to an AI agent's response by:

1. Going to **Channels > Add to live chat apps** and click on the Intercom icon
2. In the pop-up, scroll to "Use inactivity auto-close settings" and toggle "Automatically close a conversations" to the On position

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (102).png" alt="" width="474"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

3. Set the amount of time you want the ticket to close after (by default this is 60 mins)
4. (Optional) You can also set a message to send automatically when the ticket closes notifying the user the ticket will be closed.
5. These changes will go live immediately.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that emails and conversations in Intercom have separate auto-close timers so you can set different close times for each.
{% endhint %}

### Will the AI agent use responses to questions the customer has given as part of my workflow?

Yes, your AI agent will use responses given by customers to workflow questions as context for its responses.

This is a great way to improve the accuracy of your AI agent's responses and ensure a better user experience.

### Can I delay my Intercom email replies to make them seem more 'human'?

Yes, you can delay your Intercom email replies to make them seem more human.

{% hint style="info" %}
Setting the delay will only be for the first reply in the chain.
{% endhint %}

Go to **Channels > Intercom > First email reply delay** and specify the number of minutes you want the AI agent to wait before sending the reply.

When the time period is up the response will then be sent.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png" alt="" width="540"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Can I stop people speaking to a person on their first message on Intercom?

You can prevent "instant" human handover on the 1st message in a conversation on Intercom by navigating to **Channels > Intercom** and then toggling the "_Ask for more information before handover_" feature.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (69).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This option is on by default.

When a user tries to handover immediately they will be asked to provide more information first. On any subsequent messages, they can initiate a handover to an agent.

### How can I add my Intercom AI agent to other services, like WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook Messenger, or SMS?

You can use the Intercom integration to use your AI agent directly within:

* WhatsApp
* Instagram DMs
* Facebook Messenger
* SMS

It will retain all the [same features of the Intercom agent](./#how-can-i-use-my-ai-chatbot-within-intercom), including human handover, but within the respective platforms.

Refer to [Intercom's instructions on how to get each channel set-up with your AI agent](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/collections/2094746-apps-for-sales-and-support).

### Which Intercom plan do I need to be on to use My AskAI?

You can use the My AskAI Intercom integration on any Intercom plan.

### How can I pause or temporarily turn off AI replies or notes in Intercom?

To pause or temporarily pause AI replies or notes in Intercom go to Channels > Intercom then scroll to the toggle for "Pause AI agent".

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (60) (1) (1).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When you are ready to turn it back on, just toggle the Pause button once more and it will start responding again.

### Can I turn off the "Just thinking..." or "Just having a think..." messages in Intercom?

Yes, you can turn off the "Just thinking" or "Just having a think" messages.

Just go to **Channels > Intercom > Other Settings** and toggle the "Hide the "just thinking" message to off.
