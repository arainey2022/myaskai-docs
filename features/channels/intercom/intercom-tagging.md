# Intercom (Tagging)

It can take hours of repetitive work to tag and categorize your support tickets and conversations each month.

But now your AI agent can automatically do this classification and categorization for you, directly in Intercom, accurately and consistently, so you can focus on understanding what your customers are asking and how they are feeling.

### How do I set up automated tagging and sentiment scores in Intercom?

{% hint style="info" %}
Note, for Intercom tagging, only 'List' attribute types are supported. Auto-tagging will only update attributes and not "Tags".
{% endhint %}

1. To set up your tags in Intercom, go to **AI Agent Setup > Auto-Tagging** and click **Import conversation attribute.**

2. Select your attribute from the dropdown list of options (imported from Intercom) and click "Import attribute"

3. Once you have reviewed the descriptions for each attribute and checked they are correct then you can turn on the auto-tagging.
4. You will then see your tags auto-applied in Intercom. \
   If you feel any tags have been applied incorrectly, review the description for each tag to ensure it is clear.

### **Ho**w much does it cost to automatically tag and get a sentiment score for each ticket or conversation?

It costs $0.05 for each attribute per ticket, this will be an add-on to your existing subscription and charged at the end of each billing period.&#x20;

For example, if you were to have 3 attributes (tags) applied to a ticket, this would cost $0.15 for that ticket, if just one attribute needs populating it will be just $0.05 for that ticket.

### What tagging or categories can I use for my Intercom emails and conversations?

You can use your own custom tagging, categories, reason codes or groupings when tagging your Intercom emails or conversations.&#x20;

The tagging will be captured in up to 3 Intercom attributes you define, for each conversation or ticket, or within the ‘Tags’ field if you don’t use custom fields.

### What reporting do I have for my tags and sentiment?

You can use Intercom's reporting to interrogate and report on your tags and sentiment scores to see which and how they are changing over time.&#x20;

### How many options can I apply for each attribute to my Intercom emails or conversations?

We would recommend using fewer than 200 options for your attributes.

### What if I update my attributes in Intercom?

Your Auto-Tagging isn't automatically kept in sync in Intercom, so if you add or remove a field or tag in Intercom, you will have to do the same in My AskAI and vice versa (make sure the value name matches exactly).

Alternatively, you can just remove and re-add the attribute in My AskAI for it to re-sync, although be aware that descriptions will be re-written (in case you have changed many of them).

### How can I ensure the AI agent only responds to certain types of Intercom conversations or tickets?

If you are using Intercom you can use our Ticket tagging product to tell the AI agent which tickets it should respond to.

For example, you might have "reason for contact" attribute in Intercom that your agents update today, and there might be 10 category options within that.

If "unsubscribe" was the tag added by our AI agent, and that tag was on your block list, then the AI wouldn't reply to it and it will force a human handover.

To add a tag to your block list, go to **AI Agent Setup > Auto-Tagging**, select the attribute that has the tag you want to block, then find the tag and click **Block AI Replies.**

If a conversation isn't replied to because it was blocked the tag `ai-agent-tag-blocked` will also be added to the conversation.

Alternatively, you could set up a triage workflow for your AI agent, using rules or triggers within Intercom for where certain conversations should be routed depending on the "reason for contact".

### Why aren't my attributes being applied to conversations?

If your attributes aren't being applied to pre-existing fields it may be because your fields don't match.

If you are using a custom field with pre-set values in Intercom, you must ensure you use the attribute name from within Intercom exactly.

### When does the Intercom conversation attribute get added or updated when using tagging?

The live chat attribute will be updated:&#x20;

* If there are no [blocked tags or attributes](intercom-tagging.md#how-can-i-ensure-the-ai-agent-only-responds-to-certain-types-of-intercom-conversations-or-tickets) (i.e. AI is replying) then the conversation attribute is updated after 5 mins from first user message.
* If there are some blocked attributes, then the conversation attribute is updated immediately (on first the user message).

### How do I pause or turn off my Intercom Auto-Tagging?

To turn off or pause your Auto-Tagging, go to **AI Agent Setup > Auto-Tagging** and scroll to **Pause tagging**, then toggle the switch to the 'paused' position.
