### Provide your Intercom AI agent with conversation attributes from Intercom to answer user data specific questions

If you already capture lots of information on your users in Intercom, you may find it useful to provide this information to your AI agent as context so it can refer back to that information in its responses.

To do this, you will need to make a workflow where, when a conversation is initiated an Internal note is generated on the first message that contains the relevant conversation attributes.
