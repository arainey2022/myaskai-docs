# Intercom (Live Translation)

Having your AI agent be [multilingual in 95 languages](../../languages-and-localization.md) is great, but what about if you want to understand what the user/customer and the AI agent are talking about? And how are you meant to respond when the conversation is handed over to you (without a lot of back-and-forth with Google Translate?).

That's where our Live Translation feature in Intercom comes in.

With Live Translation, every message that is received from your users or customers and sent by your AI agent (both chat conversations and emails) that is not in the [default language you set in your Dashboard](../../languages-and-localization.md) will be translated into your default language, as an Internal Note, after each message (in-line).

This means you can follow the conversation, questions and response given along in real time in a language you understand.

Then, when you want to reply, you can just write your reply in your default language, click "Translate & Send". The message you send (in your language) will be saved as a note, and the message going to the user/customer will be translated into their language.

### **How do I use Live Translations in Intercom?**

Once you have set up Live Translations, all you have to do is:

1. Install our [Chrome Extension Copilot](../chrome-extension.md#how-do-i-install-the-chrome-extension)
2. When you want to respond to a message, just type your response (in your language), then click the "Translate & Send" button, instead of the usual Send button.

3. Your message will then be translated and sent automatically, with your original message saved as a note.

### Which messages get translated automatically by Live Translation?

The following messages will be translated:

* All messages received (whether in conversations your AI agent is present in or not) will be translated, both for chat/conversations and emails
* All messages sent by the AI agent will be translated&#x20;
* All messages sent by the human agent when they use the "Translate & Send" button.

### **Ho**w much does it cost to automatically translate each ticket or conversation?

It costs $0.05 to translate each ticket or conversation, regardless of length or number of characters, this will be an add-on to your existing subscription and charged at the end of each billing period.&#x20;

### How do I turn off my Intercom Live Translations?

To turn off or pause your Live Translations, go to **AI Agent Setup > Customization** and scroll to **Live Translation**, then toggle the switch to the 'Translation service disabled' position.
