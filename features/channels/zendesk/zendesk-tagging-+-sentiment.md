# Zendesk (Tagging + Sentiment)

It can take hours of repetitive work to tag and categorize your support tickets and conversations each month.

But now your AI agent can automatically do this classification and categorization for you, directly in Zendesk, accurately and consistently, so you can focus on understanding what your customers are asking and how they are feeling.

You can find the tagging app in the [Zendesk Marketplace here](https://www.zendesk.co.uk/marketplace/apps/support/1083190/ai-ticket-tagging-by-my-askai/?queryID=5d9bd561d9462ed0f8f61a97e5aebaed).

### How do I set up automated tagging and sentiment scores in Zendesk?

To set up your automated ticket or conversation tagging or sentiment scoring in Zendesk please get in touch with us via our live chat and we will assist you with the set-up.

### How much does it cost to automatically tag and get a sentiment score for each ticket or conversation?

It costs $0.10 to tag and score each conversation within Zendesk, this will be an add-on to your existing subscription and charged at the end of each billing period.&#x20;

We also offer volume discounts, get in touch with us via our live chat to learn more.

### What tagging or categories can I use for my Zendesk tickets and conversations?

You can use your own custom tagging, categories, reason codes or groupings when tagging your Zendesk tickets or conversations.&#x20;

The tagging will be captured in up to 2 Zendesk custom fields you define, for each conversation or ticket, or within the ‘Tags’ field if you don’t use custom fields.

### What reporting do I have for my tags and sentiment?

You can use Zendesk Explore to interrogate and report on your tags and sentiment scores to see which and how they are changing over time.&#x20;

### How many tags can I apply to my Zendesk tickets or conversations?

We would recommend using fewer than 200 tags.

### How can I ensure the AI agent only responds to certain types of tickets?

If you are using Zendesk Tickets you can use our Ticket tagging product to tell the AI agent which tickets it should respond to.

For example, you might have "reason for contact" field in Zendesk that your agents update today, and there might be 10 category options within that.

If "unsubscribe" was the tag added by our AI agent, and that tag was on your block list, then the AI wouldn't reply to it.

Alternatively, you could set up a triage flow for your AI agent, using rules or triggers within Zendesk for where certain tickets should be routed depending on the "reason for contact".

### Why aren't my tags being applied to pre-existing fields?

If your tags aren't being applied to pre-existing fields it may be because your custom tagging fields don't match.

If you are using a custom field with pre-set values in Zendesk, you must ensure you use the Tag from within Zendesk exactly.
