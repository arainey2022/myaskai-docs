# Zendesk

There are 3 ways you can add your AI customer service agent to Zendesk depending on your setup:

1. If you use Zendesk Ticketing (questions via email or form), you can use our Zendesk Tickets integration:

{% content-ref url="zendesk-tickets.md" %}
[zendesk-tickets.md](zendesk-tickets.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

See the Tickets app in the Zendesk marketplace:

{% embed url="https://www.zendesk.co.uk/marketplace/apps/support/1058614/my-askai-for-support/" %}

2. If you use Zendesk's Messenger, then you can use our Zendesk Messenger integration:

{% content-ref url="zendesk-messaging.md" %}
[zendesk-messaging.md](zendesk-messaging.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

See the Messenger app in the Zendesk marketplace:

{% embed url="https://www.zendesk.co.uk/marketplace/apps/messaging/139/my-askai/" %}

3. Tag your tickets automatically with AI with our tagging app:

{% content-ref url="zendesk-tagging.md" %}
[zendesk-tagging.md](zendesk-tagging.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
