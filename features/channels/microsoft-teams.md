### **How to connect to Microsoft Teams**

1. **Add the My AskAI app to your Teams Workspace**

This needs to be done by a Workspace Owner.

[https://appsource.microsoft.com/en/product/office/WA200005660?tab=Overview](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en/product/office/WA200005660?tab=Overview)\


Add My AskAI to 'a team' and then add to any 'channel'.

2. **Get your AskAI's ID and API Key**

Go to _**Channels > Slack & Teams**_ and click the Teams icon then copy your AskAI's **ID** and **API Key**.

3. **Save your AskAI's ID and API Key within Teams**

You should be automatically sent a welcome message.&#x20;

If this doesn't appear type '**@My AskAI Connect**' in any channel.

1. Select 'Connect My AskAI' from the welcome message
2. Input the ID and API Key, from the last step, into the popup within Teams
3. Select 'Submit' to save these settings

{% hint style="info" %}
If you see an issue with permissions or an error saying "The tenant admin disabled this bot", then you will need to approve the My AskAI with your Teams Organization.\
\
Please: [Manage Apps](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps) > Search: My AskAI > Select 'My AskAI' > Select 'Permissions' > Scroll down to 'Org-wide permissions' > Select 'Review permissions and consent'.\
\
You will then have to log in with your Microsoft account and approve the My AskAI app. It's been unhelpfully named, by Microsoft, as '_msbtteambtbotbtc3fe79_' within the permissions screen.

4. **Ask your first question with the @My AskAI command**

You and your team can start asking questions to your AI support agent in any channel with the **@My AskAI** command, followed by your question.

e.g. **@My AskAI what is our refund policy?**

If you want to ask a private question you can add **My AskAI** to a private Chat.
