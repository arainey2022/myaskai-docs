# Gorgias

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (29).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can now integrate your AI agent directly into Gorgias for a seamless AI support experience.

The Gorgias integration is available on all paid My AskAI plans, [see our pricing](https://myaskai.com/pricing).

### What are the benefits of using My AskAI within Gorgias?

There are several reasons why you should use your My AskAI within Gorgias:&#x20;

* While Gorgias has its own AI agent (called "AI and Automation"), it is expensive, around 5-10x the price of My AskAI per conversation (we also think ours is smarter, but we'll let you be the judge!)
* You get access to an intelligent AI agent, directly within Gorgias that can automatically and instantly answer user or visitor queries, using your company knowledgebase.
* Your AI agent can respond either [directly](gorgias.md#direct-replies) to users, generate [Internal notes](gorgias.md#internal-notes) for you.
* You can add more knowledge to your AI agent in addition to your website and Gorgias help center by using our [connections](../connections/) or [file uploads](../file-uploads.md).
* You don't have to add any code to your site and you don't need a developer, [just connect our app and you're ready to go](gorgias.md#how-to-connect-your-ai-chatbot-to-zendesk-messaging).
* AI answers provided with "References" to the sources used to answer the question.
* You can add your AI agent to Gorgias chat too as well as ticket/email replies.
* As well as an AI agent, you get all our other features like [Insights](../insights/), [Improve](../improve/), [Private (Internal) mode](../private-internal-mode.md), [Integrations with Slack](./) and more.&#x20;

### How to connect your AI agent to Gorgias

1. Install My AskAI to your Gorgias workspace (from the Gorgias App Store)
2. Login to your Dashboard and go to _**Channels**_.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (28).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

6. Once connected it'll say "Successfully connected with your Gorgias account" and look like this:

7. Once back at My AskAI, you can choose how you want your AI agent to reply separately to both email tickets or chat tickets, by default it will create [Internal Note](gorgias.md#internal-notes) responses for both, but you can also enable [Direct replies](gorgias.md#direct-replies).\

### How do I know what the Gorgias AI agent has replied to and what has been handed to a human agent?

When a ticket is replied to by your AI agent in Gorgias you will see the AI response in the ticket thread.

Additionally, a tag will be added to the conversation/ticket with `ai-agent-replied`

When a ticket is replied to by a customer (if they need more help for instance) then a tag is added to the conversation/ticket with `human-handover-requested`

This can be used to run a Trigger or Automation to re-assign a ticket to human agents.

### How can I use my AI support agent within Gorgias?

Once you've connected the My AskAI agent within to Gorgias, it will automatically start responding to user's questions with [Internal Notes](gorgias.md#internal-notes) within the Gorgias responder by default.&#x20;

#### Internal Notes

For the first question of each ticket an Internal Note will be generated by the AI, you can then use this information to assist you in the composition of your response.

With each question, the links used to answer the question will be provided.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Direct Replies

Alternatively, you can have your Gorgias AI agent respond directly to customers by toggling to "Reply directly to customers" within your Gorgias setup settings in My AskAI.

By default, all messages of the ticket and/or conversation will be replied to, however you can change this by selecting "Reply to 1st message only".

Chat:

### How does human handover work when using the Gorgias integration for email/tickets?

When using in either [Direct reply](gorgias.md#direct-replies) or [Internal Note](gorgias.md#internal-notes) reply mode for Gorgias tickets (not chat), by default your Gorgias AI agent will respond to all Ticket messages sent to you. You can change this however by selecting "Reply 1st message only".&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If you change to "Reply to 1st message only", any further questions or responses will be handed over to you, as the agent, to address.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If however, you have selected for the AI to "Reply to all messages" then you can choose when you want the AI to hand over the conversation to your human agents, either select:

* "Can't answer a question" - when it can't answer a question instead of saying as such it will automatically pass over to a person

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (21).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* "Customer handover request"- it will only handover if the customer explicitly requests to speak to a human agent&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### How does human handover work when using the Gorgias integration for chat?

When you are using your AI agent within Gorgias chat in [Direct reply](gorgias.md#direct-replies) mode, a human handover will only take place when a user asks to speak to a person directly (using any one of a number of phrases).

When they do the following happens:

* A summary of the conversation is generated for both the customer and the agent
* A `human-handover-requested` tag is applied to the conversation in Gorgias
* An internal note is added in the conversation explaining to the agent that the user has asked to speak with someone
* The AI agent will no longer respond to any further messages from the customer

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### How can I take control from the AI agent in Gorgias?

To take control from the AI agent when it is replying in Gorgias, you can either:

* Reply directly in the conversation (if using Direct replies)
* Add an internal note of `Stop writing AI notes` (if using in Internal notes mode).

### Can I use Gorgias triage or flows with my AI agent?

Unfortunately, it is currently not possible to use Gorgias triage steps or flows with your AI agent.

### Can I turn off the "Just thinking..." or "Just having a think..." messages in Gorgias?

Yes, you can turn off the "Just thinking" or "Just having a think" messages.

Just go to **Channels > Gorgias > Other Settings** and toggle the "Hide the "just thinking" message to off.

### How do I remove my Gorgias AI agent?

1. Login to your Dashboard and go to _Channels_.&#x20;
2. If enabled you will see "Live Chat apps" appear, click on the Gorgias icon.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (25).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

3. Expand the "Install My AskAI within Gorgias" header and click "Disconnect Gorgias Integration" then confirm your deletion.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (26).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### How can I pause or temporarily turn off AI replies or notes in Gorgias?

To pause or temporarily pause AI replies or notes in Gorgias go to **Channels > Gorgias** then scroll to the toggle for "Pause AI agent".

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that you will have to do this separately for Gorgias chat and Gorgias tickets.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When you are ready to turn it back on, just toggle the Pause button once more and it will start responding again.
