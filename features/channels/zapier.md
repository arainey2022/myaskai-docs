Available as an add-on for paid plans
{% endhint %}

Our Zapier app allows you to input a question and output an answer along with the references/sources.&#x20;

### How to connect to Zapier

1. **Log in or sign up to Zapier**

Create a [free Zapier account](https://zapier.com/sign-up) if you don't already have one.

2. **Create a Zap**

You can use My AskAI as an action from any trigger, you input a question, and your My AskAI returns an answer.&#x20;

If you need some inspiration on what to build, you could:

* Reply to an email with an answer to a question
* Reply to Jira tickets using your internal knowledge base
* Add an answer to new FAQs that get added to a Google Doc or Airtable from your team
* You can do almost anything you can think of!

3. **Add My AskAI, as an action, to your Zap**

Within Zapier you can search for **My AskAI** as an **Action** to add to your Zap.
