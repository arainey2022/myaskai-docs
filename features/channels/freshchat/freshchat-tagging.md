# Freshchat (Tagging)

It can take hours of repetitive work to tag and categorize your support tickets and conversations each month.

But now your AI agent can automatically do this classification and categorization for you, directly in Freshchat, accurately and consistently, so you can focus on understanding what your customers are asking and how they are feeling.

### How do I set up automated tagging and sentiment scores in Freshchat?

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can only set up Tagging for Freshchat **OR** Freshdesk, **not both**
{% endhint %}

1. To set up your tags in Freshchat, go to **AI Agent Setup > Auto-Tagging** and click **Import conversation property.**
2. Select your tag or custom field from the dropdown list of options (imported from Freshchat) and click "Import conversation property"
3. Once you have reviewed the descriptions for each conversation property and checked they are correct then you can turn on the auto-tagging.
4. You will then see your tags auto-applied in Freshchat.\
   If you feel any tags have been applied incorrectly, review the description for each tag to ensure it is clear.

### **Ho**w much does it cost to automatically tag and get a sentiment score for each ticket or conversation?

It costs $0.05 for each conversation property per ticket, this will be an add-on to your existing subscription and charged at the end of each billing period.&#x20;

For example, if you were to have 3 conversation properties applied to a ticket, this would cost $0.15 for that ticket, if just one conversation property needs populating it will be just $0.05 for that ticket.

### What tagging or categories can I use for my Freshchat conversations and tickets?

You can use your own custom tagging, conversation properties, reason codes or groupings when tagging your Freshchat conversations or tickets.&#x20;

The tagging will be captured in up to 3 Freshchat custom fields/conversation properties or tags you define, for each conversation or tickets.

### How can I ensure the AI agent only responds to certain types of Freshchat conversations?

If you are using Freshchat you can use our tagging product to tell the AI agent which tickets it should respond to.

For example, you might have "reason for contact" conversation property in Freshchat that your agents update today, and there might be 10 category options within that.

If "unsubscribe" was the tag added by our AI agent, and that tag was on your block list, then the AI wouldn't reply to it and it will force a human escalation.

To add a tag to your block list, go to **AI Agent Setup > AI Tagging**, select the conversation property that has the tag you want to block, then find the tag and click **Block.**

If a conversation isn't replied to because it was blocked (and you have [created an AI Chat Status property, following the instructions here](./#how-do-i-add-conversation-properties-so-i-know-what-the-ai-status-of-a-conversation-is)) the AI Chat Status will be updated to `ai-agent-tag-blocked`.

Alternatively, you could set up a triage flow for your AI agent, using rules or automations within Freshchat for where certain tickets should be routed depending on the "reason for contact".

### What reporting do I have for my tags and sentiment?

You can use Freshchat's reporting to interrogate and report on your tags and sentiment scores to see which and how they are changing over time.&#x20;

### How many options can I apply for each conversation property to my Freshchat conversations or tickets?

We would recommend using fewer than 200 options for your conversation properties.

### What if I update my custom fields or conversation properties in Freshchat?

Your Auto-Tagging isn't automatically kept in sync in Freshchat, so if you add or remove a field, conversation property or tag in Freshchat, you will have to do the same in My AskAI and vice versa (make sure the value name matches exactly).

Alternatively, you can just remove and re-add the tag, conversation property or custom field in My AskAI for it to re-sync, although be aware that descriptions will be re-written (in case you have changed many of them).

### Why aren't my tags, conversation properties or custom fields being applied to tickets or conversations?

If your tags aren't being applied to pre-existing fields it may be because your fields don't match.

If you are using a custom field with pre-set values in Freshchat, you must ensure you use the custom field or tag name from within Freshchat exactly.

Also, try clicking the "Update" button as sometimes Freshchat doesn't update automatically.

### How do I pause or turn off my Freshchat Auto-Tagging?

To turn off or pause your Auto-Tagging, go to **AI Agent Setup > AI Tagging** and scroll to **Pause tagging**, then toggle the switch to the 'paused' position.
