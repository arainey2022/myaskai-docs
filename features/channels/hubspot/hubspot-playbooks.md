### How I can make AI agent only respond to certain topics in HubSpot chat?

To ensure your AI agent in HubSpot only replies to certain topics you can either:

1. Have [handover guidance](../../improve/guidance.md#handover-and-escalation) in your AI agent to handover for all questions about topics you don't want it to answer on.
2. Or, you can create a [separate path in a chatflow](./#how-can-i-add-my-support-agent-as-part-of-a-triaged-chatflow-in-hubspot) where the user self-selects the non-AI topics and they never get connected with the bot.
