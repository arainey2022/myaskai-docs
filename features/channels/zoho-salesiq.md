# Zoho (SalesIQ)

### How to use your AI agent within Zoho (SalesIQ)

We do not currently have an approved integration with Zoho (SalesIQ) today.

However, we do have users who have integrated their AI agents into Zoho (SalesIQ) using "plugs".

[Read more about "plugs" here](https://www.zoho.com/salesiq/help/developer-section/plugs-in-salesiq.html).

One of our clients kindly recorded a video explaining how to complete the integration, [you can watch it here](https://www.loom.com/share/509edb3e162a41ac8f83c23f778ff958?sid=a86469aa-f515-4cfb-a2b8-f12f9ebfc2d7).&#x20;

[You can get the full instructions, plug variables and parameters here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ifiBgrqpeJV5rBNYgMSl1V_GtJDK5-LdDZjxOl0zw44/edit?tab=t.0).

While this is not a native integration, if you do need assistance and have developer resources available, get in contact with us via our chat and we will do what we can to assist you getting your agent live.
