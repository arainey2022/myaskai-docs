# 🗒️ Task End-to-End Examples

This guide walks you through creating your first [Task](./) in My AskAI — whether your task uses [Tools (APIs)](../ai-actions-tools.md) or runs without them.&#x20;

Tasks let your AI Agent handle structured, repeatable actions like updating customer details, resetting passwords, or collecting feedback.

Need some inspiration on what Task to create first?

{% content-ref url="task-use-cases.md" %}
[task-use-cases.md](task-use-cases.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

***

You can create a Task by going to **Tasks & Tools** in the left hand menu of the Dashboard and clicking "Create".&#x20;

### 1. Give Your Task a Name and Purpose

#### **Name**

Give your task a short, action-oriented title that describes what it does.

**Examples:** `Update Contact Details`, `Reset Password`, `Schedule Appointment`

#### **Description**

Explain briefly what the task helps users do.

**Example:**

```
Assist users with updating contact details on their account.
```

This description helps your team recognize the task later.

***

### 2. Add Example Triggers

#### **Example questions to trigger this task**

Provide 2–3 sample user messages that should start this task.

These help the AI agent recognize when to use it.

**Example:**

```
Can I update my contact details to x@c.com  
Please contact me on jim@email.com  
Use this alex@gmail.com and +73474385930
```

#### **Negative examples (optional)**

List examples of messages that **shouldn’t** trigger this task.

**Example:**

```
Can I update my subscription?  
Can I add a team member to my account?
```

These examples improve accuracy and reduce false positives.

***

### 3. Write Example End-to-End Flows

Show how a full conversation should go.&#x20;

Write at least one normal flow that clearly demonstrates how the AI should respond.

**Example:**

```
**Normal flow: email and phone**
- Customer: Update my details to alex@gmail.com and +73474385930
- Agent: Sure thing. To confirm, you want your new booking contact details to be alex@gmail.com and +73474385930?
- Customer: Yes
- Agent: Okay, that’s been updated for you. Please let me know if I can help with anything else.
```

Include variations where the user might only provide one piece of information (email or phone) or need to confirm details.

***

### 4. Add Handover or Escalation Rules

Sometimes users may get stuck or need human help.

Use this section to explain when the AI should hand over to a human agent.

**Example:**

```
Handover if the user is repeatedly struggling to update their contact details.
```

***

### 5. Add Instruction Steps

Instruction steps are the step-by-step recipe your AI Agent follows to complete the task.

Each step should include clear instructions in plain English.

#### Common examples:

**Step 1 – Get Contact Details**

```
Unless already provided, request the customer’s email and/or phone number they want used on their booking.
- If they already provided this, skip this step.
```

**Step 2 – Confirm Details**

```
Repeat the details back to the user before proceeding.
- If invalid or unclear (e.g., typo), ask them to confirm again.
- Allow them to edit their details if needed.
```

**Step 3 – Perform the Update**

If your task uses [tools (APIs)](task-end-to-end-examples.md#step-6-add-available-tools-optional), include the tool reference here:

```
Update the booking with the new email and phone.
- Tool: {{update_contact_details}}
- Only proceed after confirmation in Step 2.
```

{% hint style="info" %}
To reference a Tool, use the tool name enclosed in double curly braces, like this: \{{tool\_name\}}
{% endhint %}

**Step 4 – Confirm Completion**

```
Tell the customer the update was successful (or failed) and check if they need any more help.
```

If your task does not use tools, you could replace this final confirmation step with a handover for an a human agent to complete the final step.

```
Let the user know their request will be completed by the team.
- Then call {{handover}} to escalate.
```

***

### 6. Add Available Tools (Optional)

Tools (API access for AI agents) are available for accounts with 5,000+ conversations per month. You can learn more about tools below.

{% content-ref url="../ai-actions-tools.md" %}
[ai-actions-tools.md](../ai-actions-tools.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

If your task needs to use an API, you'll need to add this as a Tool first.&#x20;

This can then be reference in a task step.

**Example:**

```
Update the booking with the new email and phone.
- Tool: {{update_contact_details}}
- Only proceed after confirmation in Step 2.
```

***

### 7. Guidance for Tone and Style

Use the Guidance box to define your Agent’s tone for this task.&#x20;

Tasks don't use any existing Guidance you have for your AI agent.&#x20;

Tasks have their own Guidance that's more focused on the task at hand.

**Example:**

```
Be polite but very brief — the user wants to complete the task quickly.
```

This ensures consistency across all responses.

***

### 8. Save & Test

1. Click **Save changes** but do not set live until you've tested it
2. Once saved, close the task and test your task in the chat widget

***

### 9. Activate

1. Once it’s ready, toggle **Set task live**.
2. Click **Save changes**.

Your first AI task is now live! You can test it out in the preview widget instantly 🎉

#### 🔑 Tip

Start with a simple task (like “Update Contact Details”) before building more advanced ones.&#x20;

Once comfortable, you can chain multiple tasks or integrate APIs for full automation.
