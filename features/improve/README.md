## Improving your AI agent's answers

Your AI agent will only be able to answer questions based on the knowledge you have provided to it, if it doesn't have the knowledge it can't answer.

So you need to do 2 things to improve your AI agent's responses:

1. Find out what it can't answer
2. Add knowledge that allows it to answer

To find out what it can't answer you can use our Improve feature:

### What is 'Improve'?

Improve is our answer improvement studio that will show you:

* All the questions that your AI was unable to answer and resulted in a handover to a person, we call these your '[Knowledge Gaps](knowledge-gaps.md)'
* A way to batch '[Test](test.md)' your AI agent with a set of questions.
* How you can control the tone and behavior of your AI agent in different scenarios using '[Guidance](guidance.md)'&#x20;
* A way to '[Inspect](inspect-and-logs.md)' your AI agent's conversation history and logs, so you can understand why the AI agent answered the way it did and what knowledge sources it used.
