## Improving your AI agent's answers

Your AI agent will only be able to answer questions based on the knowledge you have provided to it, if it doesn't have the knowledge it can't answer.

So you need to do 2 things to improve your AI agent's responses:

1. Find out what it can't answer
2. Add knowledge that allows it to answer

To find out what it can't answer you can use our Improve feature:

### What is 'Improve'?

Improve is our answer improvement studio that will show you:

* All the questions that your AI was unable to answer and resulted in a handover to a person, we call these your '[Knowledge Gaps](knowledge-gaps.md)'
* Your '[Custom Answers](custom-answers.md)' - these are the knowledge snippets you have adde to your AI agent directly in My AskAI to plug any knowledge gaps
* Your '[Content Usage](content-usage.md)' - which pieces of knowledge have been used the answer your customer's and user's questions most frequently and how often they result in an AI resolution
* A way to '[Inspect](inspect-and-logs.md)' your AI agent's conversation history and logs, so you can understand why the AI agent answered the way it did and what knowledge sources it used.
