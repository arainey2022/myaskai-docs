# üîç Inspect & Logs

### How can I review previous conversations/tickets and understand why the AI agent answered how it did?

One of our most powerful features of our 'Improve' studio is the **Inspect & Bugs** view.

From this view, you can search for any ticket or conversation, by date, Ticket ID, email and/or keyword, then click into it to see the conversation/ticket history.

If you are an Intercom or Zendesk user, you can also click the Ticket ID link in the conversation/ticket view and it will take you to that ticket in your Intercom ro Zendesk account.

From the conversation/ticket history you can see:

* The knowledge sources used to answer any question
* The interpretation of the question as the AI understood it
* A button to "Inspect or fix answer"

Clicking the "Inspect or fix answer" button will generate an AI explanation of why the AI agent answered the question in the way it did and also show you exact, verbatim quotes from the docs that were used to answer the questions.&#x20;

If this wasn't a satisfactory answer for you, you will also be shown options to "Fix" the answer by either:

* Creating a [Custom Answer](inspect-and-logs.md#custom-answers)
* Adding a [Custom Instruction](../customization.md#can-i-modify-the-tone-or-the-way-the-ai-responds)

### How can I quickly find and correct a ticket or conversation?

When a conversation is handed over to a human agent a note will be generated giving you tips on how to improve the response for next time, it will offer options of:

* [Inspecting ](inspect-and-logs.md#how-can-i-see-what-content-or-knowledge-is-used-most-often-in-conversations)the conversation to see what knowledge was used
* Adding [guidance](guidance.md) to control reply tone/style & how scenarios are handled
* Creating [custom answers](inspect-and-logs.md#custom-answers) to fill knowledge gaps (draft with AI)
* Connecting your internal systems for [live customer data](../../api-documentation/user-data-api.md)
* Drafting AI replies with our [copilot extension](../channels/chrome-extension.md)

You can also turn these notes off by going to **Account Settings > Other settings > Disable admin note tips.**
