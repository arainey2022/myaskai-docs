# 📝 Custom Answers

Custom answers are the same as knowledge snippets and allow you to create custom answers to questions to have more control over your AI agent's response.&#x20;

You can use them to amend responses or enable your AI support agent to answer things it previously couldn't.

### What are custom answers?

Custom answers can be used to adjust or "correct" an AI answer.&#x20;

You can either create a new question-and-answer pairing from scratch, or you can give the AI more information that will allow it to answer a question it previously couldn't i.e. you were previously getting an "I don't know" response from your chatbot.

{% hint style="info" %}
Tip: When creating a custom answer, to get best results, type the question in 3 different ways that your users commonly ask to maximize the chance of the AI 'hitting' this response.
{% endhint %}

### When should I use custom answers?

Custom answers should be used for small corrections, adjustments, or if there is a question that doesn't warrant its own documentation.

{% hint style="info" %}
Before adding a custom answer, think about whether it would make more sense to update your documentation and [refresh the page](../adding-and-syncing-your-website-content.md#can-i-refresh-or-update-webpages-before-the-weekly-sync) to allow your AI support agent to answer instead.
