# ðŸ“Š Content Usage

### How can I see what content or knowledge is used most often in conversations?

To see what content is being used most frequently to answer questions or in conversations, go to _**Improve > Content Usage**,_ here you will find a list of the content articles that have been used to answer questions, ordered by most frequently used.

For each piece of content/knowledge you will also see an "AI resolution" rate, which will tell you how often conversations using that piece of content/knowledge were able to be directly resolved by the AI without requiring a human.

If you find pieces of content/knowledge with lower AI resolution rates it may be that they can be improved (by reviewing the conversations they are used in) or you may wish to consider other ways of helping users to answer those questions.
