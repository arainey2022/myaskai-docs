# ❓ Knowledge Gaps

### What is a knowledge gap?

A knowledge gap is a question that your AI was unable to answer and resulted in a handover to a person.

Knowledge gaps are grouped by similarity, so you can see the number and nature of common queries that are going unanswered.

We'll only show you knowledge gaps where the AI was unable to answer questions.

We'll also show you where these questions were raised so you can see the context of the conversation.

You can think of this view as your 'to-do' list to improve your AI agent's knowledge.

### How can I fix my knowledge gaps?

You can fix a knowledge gap immediately by clicking "Fix knowledge gap" and then writing your own custom answer, however My AskAI will automatically generate answers for you based on your historic tickets when the knowledge gap has reached 3 questions.

When fixing a knowledge gap you can:

1. _Generate a knowledge snippet from your existing documentation_\
   Our AI will look at similar knowledge articles in your knowledge base to make a draft of what it thinks might be a suitable knowledge article. It will not be perfect and you should add it without editing first but it should get you past the dreaded 'blank page' problem when writing new articles.
2. _Generate a knowledge snippet from your existing support tickets_\
   For each conversation that was handed over, your agents will likely have answered the customer's question themselves. So we let you connect your Zendesk or Intercom tickets so our AI can find these answers and use them to draft new knowledge articles using them (your Zendesk and Intercom Tickets won't however be used to directly answer user questions, only as a way to generate these knowledge snippets).&#x20;
3. _Draft a knowledge snippet from scratch_\
   If you don't want to use AI to generate your knowledge snippet, you can just draft one from scratch yourself using our text editor.

Whichever way you choose to begin with, you can always edit the knowledge snippet at a later date.

Once you have created your knowledge snippet click on "Save" to add this knowledge to your AI agent.
