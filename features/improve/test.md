# ☑️ Test

Our Test feature takes a sample of your historic support tickets and previous questions asked (if you have integrated [Zendesk](../channels/zendesk/) or [Intercom](../channels/intercom/)) and/or lets you add in your own test question set and shows you how your AI agent will respond to those questions, so you can see quickly how it will perform on day 1.

You can find Test in your Dashboard under **Improve > Test**.

### How do I add test questions to my AI agent to evaluate its performance?

There are 2 ways you can add test questions to your AI agent to evaluate its performance:

1. If you have your [Zendesk](../channels/zendesk/) or [Intercom](../channels/intercom/) connected then when you are on the Test page you will see an option to "Create from previous Intercom/Zendesk conversations". \
   \
   Clicking this button will import a sample of up to 50 historic conversations or tickets to use as your test question set.

2. You can manually add test questions by typing your test question in the text entry field and then clicking the "+ Test Question" button.&#x20;

Once you have added your test question set you will then be able to click into each question and see how your AI agent would have responded.

### How do I improve my AI agent responses once I have tested them?

Once you have tested your AI agent's responses, if you want to change or improve them you can add more [Knowledge](../connections/), [Guidance](guidance.md) or a [Custom Answer](custom-answers.md).

If you click into the question and scroll to the bottom of the response you'll see options to do all of these or you can go directly to them in the Dashboard menu.

### What do the "AI Resolved" and "Answered" columns mean in Test?

When you see AI Resolved in Test it shows whether the conversation would have been automatically handed over to a person or not.

You can change whether this happens automatically by applying [Handover & Escalation Guidance](guidance.md#handover-and-escalation).

When you see Answered in Test it shows whether the AI agent had sufficient knowledge added to it to answer the question.

You can add more knowledge to improve this via [Connections](../connections/) or [Custom Answers](custom-answers.md).

### How do I retest my question in Test once I have updated Guidance or added more knowledge?

If you have just updated guidance or knowledge and want to retest for a single, particular question, then you can select that question in Test, then click "Refresh" and a response will be regenerated.
