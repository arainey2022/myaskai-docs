#### [‚Äã](https://docs.carbon.ai/connectors/onedrive#microsoft-admin-approval-2)Microsoft Admin Approval <a href="#microsoft-admin-approval-2" id="microsoft-admin-approval-2"></a>

To allow My AskAI to access your Microsoft applications (OneDrive and SharePoints), users might need to request admin consent approval.

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide:

#### [‚Äã](https://docs.carbon.ai/connectors/onedrive#prerequisites-2)Prerequisites <a href="#prerequisites-2" id="prerequisites-2"></a>

Before you begin, ensure you have:

* Gone through My AskAI's managed OAuth flow and submitted the admin consent request (see screenshot below):

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (53).png>)

* An administrator role or designated reviewer role to review admin consent requests

#### [‚Äã](https://docs.carbon.ai/connectors/onedrive#approve-the-request)Approve the Request <a href="#approve-the-request" id="approve-the-request"></a>

1. Sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center as at least a Cloud Application Administrator who is a designated reviewer.
2. Navigate to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications**.
3. Under **Activity**, select **Admin consent requests**.
4. Select the **My Pending** tab to view and act on the pending requests.
5. From the list, select the My AskAI application that is being requested.
6. Review the request details:
   * Select **Review permissions and consent** to see what permissions are being requested by My AskAI.
   * Select the **App details** tab to view the application details.
   * Select the **Requested by** tab to see who is requesting access and why.
7. **Approve the request** to grant admin consent to allow My AskAI to access your Microsoft application. All requestors will be notified that their request for access is granted. This allows all users in your tenant to access My AskAI unless otherwise restricted with user assignment.

#### Do You Have the Right Permissions?

If you are unable to consent to the approval request under **My Pending** because the admin consent flow has not been activated, then you will need **Global Administrator** permissions. Once you are a **Global Administrator**, you can set up the admin consent flow or consent directly via My AskAI's managed OAuth flow.

### Confluence

To authorize your Confluence connection, you just need to provide the Confluence sub-domain of the workspace you want to connect to when asked, then log in with your Confluence account details to approve.

When you connect Confluence, the content that will be synced will be the same content that the user profile (used to authenticate with Confluence) has access to (i.e. all available content, you can't choose specific content to add).&#x20;

If you want to choose specific content to add from Confluence you can create a separate, specific account on Confluence that has access to certain 'spaces' to make sure that only certain content is synced.

For example, if the Confluence workspace URL is `https://myaskai.confluence.com`, then`myaskai` will be the subdomain.
