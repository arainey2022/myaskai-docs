# ðŸ‘¤ User Data API setup

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have a Shopify store, you can use our [no-code Shopify connector](../shopify.md)
{% endhint %}

#### **Overview**

This API, provided by your company, allows us to retrieve user information based on a provided identifier. The endpoint will accept a POST request and will return relevant user data.

### How to set up your User Data API

1. Login to your Dashboard and go to **Knowledge**
2. Scroll to **Connect live user data** and click the button that says **<> Add (or Manage) API Connection**

4. Enter a test user email address that will return a response when your Endpoint is called and click **Test User Data API,** you should then see your example response appear below.\
   You can retest this response until you are satisfied with the test data returned.

5. Once you are happy with the User Data API response you can click the toggle to **Activate live user data**. From this point on, when a user contacts you, if they have a validated email address, we send a request for user data to your API and then your AI agent will use this data in its responses.
