#### What is self-learning?

Self-learning is the ability for your AI agent to learn from your human agent conversations, ensuring that you don't have to manually update its knowledge on an ongoing basis.&#x20;

It happens automatically behind the scenes, without you having to lift a finger.

You can access self-learning by going to your Dashboard, clicking on "Improve," and then "Self-Learning."

#### How does self-learning work?

Self-learning works by looking at human agent replies to conversations or tickets which have been escalated and looking at the knowledge that was missing from the AI agent in order to respond to the ticket.&#x20;

It's identifying the difference between what the human knows and what the AI agent knows and then using that difference to create an article that can be used by the AI agent in the future to respond to questions.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The AI agent will only identify self-learning opportunities where the knowledge is generalizable. It will not learn off user-specific information.
{% endhint %}

#### Which modes does self-learning work in?

Self-learning works in both direct reply and notes mode.&#x20;

**Direct reply**

In direct reply mode it will look at any conversation where the ticket has been escalated to a person.

It will then look at the human agents' replies and responses and the AI agents' replies and responses to compare them.

**Note reply**

In notes mode it will look at the whole conversation or ticket (the human replies and the AI replies) and identify the gap between them, filling any gaps in the AI agent's knowledge.

This means that while you are testing out your AI agent in Notes mode, it's going to be continually learning and improving using your human agent replies, so make sure you keep it on during your trial period!

#### How do I see what it has learned?

To see the self-learning knowledge go to your dashboard, then click on "Improve" and then "Self-learning" where you'll see a list of AI-generated articles.&#x20;

Click into one of these articles and a side panel will open up where you should see the AI-generated content.

#### Can I edit the self-learning?

Yes you can edit the self-learning content.

1. Go to your Dashboard
2. Click on "Improve" and then "Self-learning"
3. Click on the article

This will open a side panel where you'll see the AI-generated content and you can access and edit the content itself directly.&#x20;

You can also preview to see what that content will look like.&#x20;

Edits are made in Markdown.

#### How do I change the tone of voice of the AI articles being generated?

To change the tone of voice used by the AI when generating AI articles in self-learning:

1. Go to the Dashboard.
2. Click on Improve > Self-learning.
3. Then go to Settings.
4. You'll see a section called "Change tone of voice for AI articles". In here you can edit the tone of voice prompt.
5. You can either use our standard auto-generated prompt that has been generated for your business from your home page or use your favourite AI tool to help you create a new tone of voice prompt.

#### Can I turn off self-learning?

Self-learning is on by default for all new accounts.&#x20;

Articles are automatically published however you can choose to turn this publishing off by either going to Settings within the **Dashboard > Improve > Self-learning** and turning off or unpublishing the articles in their entirety, or you can unpublish individual articles one at a time by toggling the "published/unpublished" switch for each article.

#### How often will it update its self-learning?

Self-learning articles are updated on a weekly basis using all of the updated human replies from the previous week.
