  In addition to the visitor or customer facing mode of your AI agent, you can
  also have "Private" mode, that you can use for your team, trained on material
  that isn't public.

# ðŸ”“ Private (Internal) mode

{% hint style="success" %}
Available on all paid plans.
{% endhint %}

Your AI agent has 2 modes depending on how you want to use it:

* **Public mode (Private content hidden)**: This is the mode used when you embed your AI agent on a webpage, it only has access to websites uploaded and any content you explicitly designate as "public".
* **Public + Private mode:** This is the mode you should use when using your AI agent internally, within your business, it has access to all content added or uploaded to your agent.

### How to use your AI agent internally (Public v Private mode)

### Accessing public or public + private modes

There are a few ways you can access each mode:

#### **Chat**

When you log in to your Dashboard, on the Knowledge, Customization or Human Handover views you will see and be able to test your AI agent.

In the bottom left corner, you will see a toggle switch, which will allow you to change between "Public only" or "Public + Private" modes.

#### Slack, Teams, Zapier, API

When using any of our integrations with [Slack](channels/slack.md), [Microsoft Teams](channels/microsoft-teams.md), [Zapier](channels/zapier.md) or the [API](broken-reference), responses will be given using the Public + Private mode, so your team can access answers on your complete knowledge base.

### Setting visibility on files and connections

Each type of content added to your AI agent's knowledge base can be specified as "Public" or "Public + Private", except for the content added from your public site, which is always classed "Public".&#x20;

#### File uploads

By default, [files uploaded](private-internal-mode.md#file-uploads) to your AI agent are public.&#x20;

You can change this either for all files at once:

1. Go to _**Knowledge > Upload files**_
2. Click "**Manage**"
3. Click on the :gear: icon next to "Content visibility"
4. Select either "**Set all to Public**" or "**Set all to Private**"
5. Each file will then be classified in your chosen setting, this may take a few minutes depending on the number of files you have uploaded.
