### Where can I find the Shopify app?

You can find our Shopify app [here](https://apps.shopify.com/my-askai-ai-support-agent).

### How do I connect my Shopify store to my AI Agent?

Connecting your Shopify store to your AI agent, along with your product pages and customer order data doesn't require a developer, just a few clicks.

1. Log into your [Dashboard](https://myaskai.com/dashboard) and go to **Knowledge > Connect Shopify store** then click "Connect Shopify store"

2. Enter your Shopify store name in the store name field. Your store name can be found in the URL of your admin center if you are unsure.

3.  Once connected, we will automatically sync all of your Shopify store:

    1. Pages
    2. Products
    3. Customer data

    You will see the content (pages and products) sync almost immediately.

4. The setup for your Shopify store connection to your AI agent is now complete. \
   \
   You can check the content synced by clicking the **"Content (x pages/products)"** button which will show a list of every page your AI agent has access to.

5. Once you have clicked the "**Content (x pages/products)**" button and can see your content, if you want to "hide" any Shopify pages from your AI agent's knowledge you can do so by toggling the "Public" toggle next to that page to "Private". \
   Your AI agent will then no longer be able to answer using that content.

### How do I turn off the customer data sync in my Shopify store?

To turn off the customer data sync from your Shopify store go to **Knowledge > Connected Shopify store** then click the Gear/Settings icon (‚öôÔ∏è) and expand the second section (Configure your Shopify connection).

You will see a toggle under "AI agent access to customer data", if you toggle this "Off" your AI will no longer be able to access your customer data and will immediately be unable to answer questions about recent orders or transactions.

### How do I disconnect my Shopify store and all of content and user data from my AI agent?

To disconnect your Shopify store and delete all of your content and user data uninstall the My AskAI app from the your Shopify admin panel within Shopify by going to:

**Settings (Gear icon) > Apps and sales channels > Find the My AskAI app and click the three dots (...) then click "Uninstall"**

Your account and all data will then be deleted within 48hrs.

### How can users check their Shopify order status?

There are 2 ways users can check details of their Shopify orders:

1. If you are using the My AskAI chat widget on your site, they can click the "**Get order status**" button and enter their email and order number and it will return:
   1. Order number
   2. Order date
   3. Price of order
   4. Items ordered
   5. Any tracking links from Shopify
   6. Their Shopify order status page&#x20;

2. The other way users can get details of their Shopify orders is through any of our [integration channels](channels/).\
   \
   In these, if a user contacts you asking for any order updates or details, your AI agent will automatically be able to retrieve such details and provide answers on them (as their email address has been verified).
