# ✏️ Improve + Custom answers

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/custom answers (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Improving your AI agent's answers

Your AI agent will only be able to answer questions based on the knowledge you have provided to it, if it doesn't have the knowledge it can't answer.

So you need to do 2 things to improve your AI agent's responses:

1. Find out what it can't answer
2. Add knowledge that allows it to answer

To find out what it can't answer you can use our Improve feature:

## Improve

### What is 'Improve' and what is a 'knowledge gap'?

Improve is our answer improvement studio that will show you:

* all the questions that your AI was unable to answer and resulted in a handover to a person, we call these your 'knowledge gaps'
* your 'Custom Answers' - these are the knowledge snippets you have adde to your AI agent directly in My AskAI to plug any knowledge gaps
* your 'Content Usage' - which pieces of knowledge have been used the answer your customer's and user's questions most frequently and how often they result in an AI resolution
* a way to 'Inspect' your AI agent's conversation history and logs, so you can understand why the AI agent answered the way it did and what knowledge sources it used.

### What is a knowledge gap?

A knowledge gap is a question that your AI was unable to answer and resulted in a handover to a person.

Knowledge gaps are grouped by similarity, so you can see the number and nature of common queries that are going unanswered.

We'll only show you knowledge gaps where the AI was unable to answer questions.

We'll also show you where these questions were raised so you can see the context of the conversation.

You can think of this view as your 'to-do' list to improve your AI agent's knowledge.

### How can I fix my knowledge gaps?

You can fix a knowledge gap immediately by clicking "Fix knowledge gap" and then writing your own custom answer, however My AskAI will automatically generate answers for you based on your historic tickets when the knowledge gap has reached 3 questions.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-04-22 082351.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When fixing a knowledge gap you can:

1. _Generate a knowledge snippet from your existing documentation_\
   Our AI will look at similar knowledge articles in your knowledge base to make a draft of what it thinks might be a suitable knowledge article. It will not be perfect and you should add it without editing first but it should get you past the dreaded 'blank page' problem when writing new articles.
2. _Generate a knowledge snippet from your existing support tickets_\
   For each conversation that was handed over, your agents will likely have answered the customer's question themselves. So we let you connect your Zendesk or Intercom tickets so our AI can find these answers and use them to draft new knowledge articles using them (your Zendesk and Intercom Tickets won't however be used to directly answer user questions, only as a way to generate these knowledge snippets).&#x20;
3. _Draft a knowledge snippet from scratch_\
   If you don't want to use AI to generate your knowledge snippet, you can just draft one from scratch yourself using our text editor.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-04-22 082648.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Whichever way you choose to begin with, you can always edit the knowledge snippet at a later date.

Once you have created your knowledge snippet click on "Save & Test", this will show you what response your AI agent will give to your question, you can then choose to either add this snippet to your AI agent's knowledge (if you are happy with the response) by clicking 'Finish' or continue editing (if you don't like the response) by clicking 'Back/Edit'.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (419).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If you add the snippet the knowledge gap will be Resolved and will be cleared from your Improve view.

### What do I do if I think a knowledge gap should have been answered?

If you believe the questions within a knowledge gap should have been answered, you should click the:

_"Should this have been answered?"_ link for that knowledge gap in the three dot menu for that knowledge gap.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-04-22 082406.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You will then be asked to:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (421).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

1. Re-check if the knowledge gap is still there (in case you have added knowledge since the gap appeared)
2. Search for the link you believe contains the knowledge that would answer the question (this is to ensure you have added the link to your AI agent already).
   1. If you don't find the link we will ask if you want to add it to your AI agent's knowledge
   2. If you do find the link then we will ask for further information
3. Copy and paste the link and the exact text from within the article that answers the question.
4. Report the issue - this will then be used by My AskAI as part of our answer improvement and evaluation testing to constantly improve our AI agent's responses.
5. Add a knowledge snippet to directly answer the question for customers while we investigate.

### How do I connect my Zendesk or Intercom tickets?

{% hint style="info" %}
These will be added automatically on signup and connection to Zendesk and Intercom, if they haven't been, follow the below steps.
{% endhint %}

To connect your Zendesk or Intercom tickets so your AI agent can draft knowledge snippets:

1. Go to your dashboard then select **Improve** from the menu.
2. Go to any Knowledge gap and click '**Fix Knowledge Gap**'
3. When presented with the options where you can draft your knowledge from, select '**Support Tickets**'.
4. Select your support platform, Zendesk or Intercom on the next screen.
5. Follow the instructions to connect to your respective ticketing platform.
6. Once connected you should be able to draft knowledge snippets from your tickets.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Note that while historic tickets from Zendesk and Intercom can be used to generate knowledge snippets (custom answers), they cannot be used as a knowledge source to directly answer customer questions from.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
To remove tickets, please send us a message via our live chat.
{% endhint %}

## Custom Answers

Custom answers are the same as knowledge snippets and allow you to create custom answers to questions to have more control over your AI agent's response.&#x20;

You can use them to amend responses or enable your AI support agent to answer things it previously couldn't.

{% hint style="success" %}
Available on all paid plans.
{% endhint %}

### How to Improve Your AI Agent Answers

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/SjMDPjvvSrw?si=nMWCuAFtaMHZTFgt" %}

### What are custom answers?

Custom answers can be used to adjust or "correct" an AI answer.&#x20;

You can either create a new question-and-answer pairing from scratch, or you can give the AI more information that will allow it to answer a question it previously couldn't i.e. you were previously getting an "I don't know" response from your chatbot.

{% hint style="info" %}
Tip: When creating a custom answer, to get best results, type the question in 3 different ways that your users commonly ask to maximize the chance of the AI 'hitting' this response.
{% endhint %}

### When should I use custom answers?

Custom answers should be used for small corrections, adjustments, or if there is a question that doesn't warrant its own documentation.

{% hint style="info" %}
Before adding a custom answer, think about whether it would make more sense to update your documentation and [refresh the page](sitesync-adding-and-syncing-your-website-content.md#can-i-refresh-or-update-webpages-before-the-weekly-sync) to allow your AI support agent to answer instead.
{% endhint %}

### How do I create a custom answer?

To create a custom answer (or to correct a response):

1. Go to **Knowledge > Custom answers** or go directly to **Improve**
2. Select "_Add/manage custom answers_"

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-04-22 082614.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-04-22 082630.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

5. Click "Save & Test", this will show you what response your AI agent will give to your question
6. You can then choose to either add this snippet to your AI agent's knowledge (if you are happy with the response) by clicking 'Finish' or continue editing (if you don't like the response) by clicking 'Back/Edit'.

That's it, you should be able to then ask your AI agent the question and have it respond with the updated response.&#x20;

### How do I delete a custom answer?

To delete a custom answer:

1. Go to **Improve > Custom Answers**
2. Select the Custom Answer you wish to delete.
3. Click the trash can icon next to that Custom Answer and you answer will be deleted immediately.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-04-22 082614 (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### How do I edit a custom answer or knowledge snippet?

To edit a custom answer:

1. Go to **Improve > Custom answers**
2. Select the Custom Answer you wish to edit.
3. Click the button pencil icon next to that Custom Answer.
4. Update your Custom Answer/knowledge snippet and click "Save & Test"

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (485).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### How do I edit an existing answer?

To edit an existing answer your AI support agent is giving, [create a new custom answer](improve-+-custom-answers.md#how-do-i-create-a-custom-answer) or knowledge snippet using the question you asked and your updated response.

### How can I see all my custom answers and knowledge snippets?

To view all of your custom answers and knowledge snippets, go to **Improve > Custom answers**

### How can I see what content or knowledge is used most often in conversations?

To see what content is being used most frequently to answer questions or in conversations, go to _**Improve > Content Usage**,_ here you will find a list of the content articles that have been used to answer questions, ordered by most frequently used.

For each piece of content/knowledge you will also see an "AI resolution" rate, which will tell you how often conversations using that piece of content/knowledge were able to be directly resolved by the AI without requiring a human.

If you find pieces of content/knowledge with lower AI resolution rates it may be that they can be improved (by reviewing the conversations they are used in) or you may wish to consider other ways of helping users to answer those questions.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-04-22 082704.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### How can I review previous conversations/tickets and understand why the AI agent answered how it did?

One of our most powerful features of our 'Improve' studio is the **Inspect & Bugs** view.

From this view, you can search for any ticket or conversation, by date, Ticket ID, email and/or keyword, then click into it to see the conversation/ticket history.

If you are an Intercom or Zendesk user, you can also click the Ticket ID link in the conversation/ticket view and it will take you to that ticket in your Intercom ro Zendesk account.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-04-22 082837.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

From the conversation/ticket history you can see:

* The knowledge sources used to answer any question
* The interpretation of the question as the AI understood it
* A button to "Inspect or fix answer"

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-04-22 082859.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Clicking the "Inspect or fix answer" button will generate an AI explanation of why the AI agent answered the question in the way it did and also show you exact, verbatim quotes from the docs that were used to answer the questions.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-04-22 082921.png" alt="" width="548"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If this wasn't a satisfactory answer for you, you will also be shown options to "Fix" the answer by either:

* Creating a [Custom Answer](improve-+-custom-answers.md#custom-answers)"
* Adding a [Custom Instruction](customization.md#can-i-modify-the-tone-or-the-way-the-ai-responds)"

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-04-22 083149.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### How can I quickly find and correct a ticket or conversation?

When a conversation is handed over to a human agent a note will be generated giving you tips on how to improve the response for next time, it will offer options of:

* [Inspecting ](improve-+-custom-answers.md#how-can-i-see-what-content-or-knowledge-is-used-most-often-in-conversations)the conversation to see what knowledge was used
* Adding [guidance](guidance.md) to control reply tone/style & how scenarios are handled
* Creating [custom answers](improve-+-custom-answers.md#custom-answers) to fill knowledge gaps (draft with AI)
* Connecting your internal systems for [live customer data](../api-documentation/user-data-api.md)
* Drafting AI replies with our [copilot extension](channels/chrome-extension.md)

You can also turn these notes off by going to **Account Settings > Other settings > Disable admin note tips.**
