{% hint style="success" %}
Seats on the Pro plan are unlimited.
{% endhint %}

You may want other people in your business to see what is being asked by your customers or visitors. Luckily you can invite them to your Insights dashboard so they can see everything, each team member you invite is classed as a "seat".

### What will team members be able to see/do?

When you invite a team member, they will always be able to see and act on anything on your insights page and test your AI support agent.

They will also be included in emails sent to users when a topic hits 3 conversations.&#x20;

Then, you can choose whether you want to:

* Limit their access to this so they will not be able to see any of the AI agent setup screens, customization or add additional team members themselves OR&#x20;
* You can give them access to all of the above, only preventing them from accessing "Account settings".
* You can set them as an "Admin" which will mean they have access to all features "Account settings" and be able to invite other team members to the account.

This is done by using the "Insights only" and "Admin" toggles in the Account Settings.

### How do I invite team members?

To invite a team member to your My AskAI account (ensure you are already on a paid plan):

1. Go to **Account settings** within your [Dashboard](https://www.myaskai.com/dashboard)
2. Add your team members' email addresses and click Add
3. Choose whether you want to give them full access or "Insights only" access and whether or not you want that person to be an "Admin" (i.e. able to set roles and invite other users).
4. Once added click "Copy invite info" and paste it into an email/message to send to the user (we do this so they aren't getting a random email from us that they ignore!)
5. When they receive the email/message and click the associated link, they will be able to sign in and create an account to access the Dashboard.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Invited team members cannot signup with Google sign in, they must use magic-link logins
{% endhint %}

### How much does it cost to invite team members to My AskAI?

The price will depend on your plan, see the table below, note that prices are monthly, even if you are on an Annual plan:

| Plan       | Team access        |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| Essentials | $25/month per seat |
| Pro        | Unlimited seats    |
| Enterprise | Unlimited seats    |

### Can I share a link to the AI agent with my team?

Yes, you can share a link to the AI agent with your team, just go to your _**Dashboard > Channels**_ then copy the link to the share page you see and share it with your team or colleagues.&#x20;

Do I need team seats for all members of my team?

You do not need to have team seats for all members of your team, only the people you want to add or update knowledge or the people you want to view insights.&#x20;

You do not need to match the team seats you have in other platforms like Intercom, Zendesk or HubSpot.
