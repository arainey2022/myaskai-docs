# ðŸ‘¤ User details API specification

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have a Shopify store, you can use our [no-code Shopify connector](../shopify.md)
{% endhint %}

#### **Overview**

This API, provided by your company, allows us to retrieve user information based on a provided identifier. The endpoint will accept a POST request and will return relevant user data.

#### **Endpoint**

* **Example URL:** `https://api.client.com/user-data`
* **Method:** `POST`

#### **Headers**

* **Authorization** (required): The request must include an `Authorization` header with an API key provided to My AskAI.
* **Content-Type** (required): The request should accept only: `application/json`
* No other headers are required.

#### **Request Body**

The request will come from My AskAI with every new support ticket or support conversation.

The request body will be in JSON format and will include only the following field:

```json
{
	"identifier": "alex@alex.com"
}
```

* `identifier`: (String) The unique email of the user whose data is being requested. This must be available to My AskAI from an authenticated or valid source e.g. extracted from a Zendesk ticket or authenticated Intercom conversation

#### **Response**

The API must respond with a JSON object containing the requested user information:

```json
{
	"user_info": "Name: Alex Johnson\nEmail: alex@alex.com\nSubscription: Premium Subscription (Monthly)\nSubscription Start Date: January 15, 2024\nNext Renewal Date: October 15, 2024\n\nRecent Orders:\n1.
