# 🎫 Training on historic tickets

{% hint style="success" %}
Included in the Scale plan and as an add-on ($499, one-off fee) for the Pro plan.
{% endhint %}

There are lots of reasons you may want to train on your past/historic tickets:

* You have been too busy to keep your docs up-to-date
* Your product has grown so fast that you never got a chance to create your docs in the first place

Whatever the reason, we can help.

Now all you need to do is connect your helpdesk, and we'll train on 10,000+ of your historic tickets.

We'll then provide you with a set of output help center articles to use in your AI agent or publish to your help center.

#### Which helpdesks can you generate articles from?

Our historic ticket training is available for all of our major helpdesk integrations:

* Intercom
* Zendesk
* Freshdesk / Freshchat
* Gorgias
* HubSpot

#### How do you get access to my historic tickets?

To access your historic tickets we have a direct API integration with the respective helpdesks.

You will then provide approved access so we can connect and extract the necessary tickets.&#x20;

#### How many help articles will be generated?

We will generate around 20 detailed, grouped help articles (you can think of them as category pages), that will have multiple relevant bits of knowledge in each page.

#### What format will the articles that are generated from historic tickets be in?

You'll be able to access the articles at a hosted URL (which you can then add to your My AskAI AI agent), but you'll also be able to copy and download the markdown to add to any helpdesk.

#### Can I edit the AI articles once they have been generated?

Yes, you can edit the AI articles once they have been generated, whether in the output provided directly or by editing the markdown before entering it into your help center.&#x20;

#### Can I train on specific tickets?

By default, the AI articles will be generated on all historic tickets.

If this is an issue or you need to train only on a subset, get in touch with us via live chat and ask to speak to a person.
