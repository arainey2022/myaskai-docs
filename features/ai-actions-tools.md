  Having your AI support agent answer questions based on knowledge and user data
  is all well and good, but what about if you want it to start doing things for
  you, on your behalf, to truly automate?

# üõ†Ô∏è AI Actions (Tools)

### What are tools?

Tools are how your AI support agent can interact with your systems and backend in a more autonomous way.

For each ticket, your AI agent will decide whether or not it needs to use a tool you give it access to, so it will only use the tool when it deems it necessary.&#x20;

### What can tools be used for?

Tools can be used for pretty much any action you would use an API for today.&#x20;

Examples include:

* Looking up data that isn't necessarily user-specific, such as property or product lookups
* Automating cancellations
* Automating refunds
* Automating background checks
* Automating customer data updates, e.g. address updates

Your AI agent will understand the ticket it is answering and decide when it needs to take action using one of these tools.

### How do tools differ from the User Data API?

You can think of tools as 'action-orientated' (for example, [used for the above types of task](ai-actions-tools.md#what-can-tools-be-used-for)) and to be used for obtaining data that isn't specific to a user.

The [User Data API](../api-documentation/user-data-api.md) is to be used when you need to retrieve information or data about a specific user.

### How do I set up tools?

To set up tools, please get in touch with us via the live chat in your Dashboard and ask to "Talk to a person".

### How much do tools cost?

Tool calls cost $0.05 per ticket or conversation, you will only pay for tickets where tool calls are made. So if you have 2 tickets, one that requires a tool call and one that doesn't you will only pay $0.05.&#x20;

You will only pay for a tool call once per ticket or conversation.
