# ❓ AI answers on your content

### How many pieces of content can my AI support agent use in its answer?

Your AI agent will look over all the help documentation, knowledge articles and content you add, and identify the 6 most relevant pieces of text from them to use to answer your question. This means that the answer will reference at most 6 different webpages, help documents or knowledge articles, but it may only reference 1 if all pieces of text came from the same source.

### Do you answer based on multiple pages or pieces of content?

Yes, when you ask a question the most relevant text is taken from across all your knowledge and help articles at once to find the pieces that can be used to answer your question. This could mean that it answers based on a single article, multiple articles, or across 6 or more separate sources.

### How long are the answers?

The length of answers varies depending on:

* The knowledge articles and content you have uploaded.
* The complexity of your question.

In short - it depends!

### What content can I add to my AI support agent?

The following content can be added to your AI agent to "train" it:

### Will it output page numbers in the references and sources?

Your AI support agent is unable to output page numbers currently, this is in part [because we do not store any of the documents you upload to our servers](../security-+-privacy/privacy/your-content.md).
