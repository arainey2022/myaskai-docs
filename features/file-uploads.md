  In addition to webpages and files or pages from connected sources, you can
  also upload local files to train your AI support agent so it can better answer
  questions.

# ðŸ“‚ File uploads

{% hint style="success" %}
Available on all paid plans.
{% endhint %}

To add more knowledge (in addition to adding [website content](sitesync-adding-and-syncing-your-website-content.md) and [connected content](connections/)) to your AI chatbot you can upload files from your local device.

By default, all files uploaded are marked "Public". [You can also make them private](private-internal-mode.md#setting-visibility-on-files-and-connections).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If files or pages uploaded are marked "Public", no links to internal content will be shared as references when displayed publicly (i.e. as a widget on your site).
{% endhint %}

### How do I upload a file?

To upload a file to your AI support agent:

1. Go to _**Knowledge > Upload files.**_
2. Click "**Upload files**".
3. Click on the "**File picker**".
4. Drag and drop any files or click the button to select files from your computer (up to 25 at once).
5. Once dropped or selected the files will be added immediately.

### How do I remove or delete a file?

To delete a file from your AI support agent:

1. Go to &#x4B;_**nowledge > Upload files**_
2. Click "**Manage**"
3. Search for and select the file you want to remove and click the trash can icon :wastebasket: next to the item

Once a file is removed from the knowledge of a chatbot it is no longer used by the AI to answer questions and that knowledge is removed.

### Who sees the files I have uploaded?

[File uploads are public by default](private-internal-mode.md#file-uploads), this means they are used to answer questions in the public-facing widget unless you explicitly choose for them not to be, this is [explained in more detail here](private-internal-mode.md#file-uploads).

The links to those files will not be shared when the AI answers questions - this is mainly because the pages and documents are not always accessible.&#x20;

### Which file formats can I upload?

You can upload the following file formats:

* pdf&#x20;
* xlsx
* csv\*
* docx
* txt
* md
* rtf
* tsv
* pptx
* mp3
* mp4 (audio only)
* mp2
* aac
* wav
* flac
* pcm
* m4a
* ogg
* opus
* webm

\*Note that for csv files each row resides on its own line, and each element within the row has the header of its corresponding column added to it as a prefix.

### What are the file size limitations?

The maximum size of a local file to be uploaded is 30MB.&#x20;

### How many files or folders can I upload?

You can upload as many files or folders as you want, however you can only upload 25 files or folders at a time via the user interface.
