From there you will be asked to give the Starter action a:

* Title - this will be what the user sees first, as a button within your starter questions
* Description - the user sees this after they click the 1st button, you can use this to provide more information
* Button copy/text - the button used to take the user to whatever URL you choose
* Destination URL - where you want to take the user once they have clicked the starter action button, this could be a booking page, a pricing page or anything else you can think of.

Then, once you have completed these you save your action and then test it out.&#x20;

You can have a maximum of 3 starter questions or actions (or any mixture thereof).
