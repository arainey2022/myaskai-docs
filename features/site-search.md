# üîç Site search

{% hint style="info" %}
Site search is only available when using My AskAI via the My AskAI widget, it is not available with any integrations.
{% endhint %}

Site search is for when you don't want to chat, you just want to search a site to find the right pages to help you out.

Think of it as a much better version of search than the one you already have on your site.&#x20;

Your AI support agent will look over all pages added and list out up to 10 relevant results for your search query, using the same technology we use to answer your questions in conversations, and best of all, you get unlimited site searches on all plans (including free).

You can easily switch between Search and Conversation modes in the Widget navigation menu when you need to.

Here it is in action:
