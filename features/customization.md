You can customize your AI agent to match your business brand with just a few clicks, just head to _**AI agent setup > Customization**_:

### Starter questions

These are the questions your customers and visitors will see when they first see your widget, you could make them your most common questions or questions you want them to ask or even to direct them to something topical for your company.

### Company name

This is the name that will appear at the top of your AI agent, followed by "support assistant", it is also used so your AI knows who it works for!

### Brand logo

This will be used for your AI's logo when it interacts with your customer or visitor.

### Brand colour

This is the colour that will be used for your widget's menu bar, user icon and fonts.

### Welcome message

This is the first message a customer or visitor sees when they open your widget, you could use it to say hello, to give the user a little more information or tell them what sorts of things they should ask your AI chatbot.

### Remove branding

You can also [remove our branding](remove-branding.md) if you want for $49/mo.

### Widget behaviour

To tweak how your widget behaves, go to _**Channels > Add to your website:**_

#### Chat widget

* Pulsate: Your chat icon will "pulse" in the bottom corner of the page for 10 seconds (or until opened), to draw more attention to it, again this will only be for 1st-time visitors.
* Animated chat icon: Your chat icon will have a subtle animation, again to draw attention to it for the user.
* Chat icon color: Edit the color of the chat icon to match your brand, just choose your HEX code.&#x20;

#### Chat embed

* Live chat widget visibility: You can choose if you want us to hide your live chat widget by default, until someone asks to talk to a person with your My AskAI.

### Can I modify the tone or the way the AI responds?

You can modify the tone or the way the AI responds by using our "[Guidance](improve/guidance.md)" feature.

To do this go to your **Dashboard > Improve > Guidance** then enter your guidance to the AI.

Adding guidance here will modify how your AI agent is able to respond.

You will likely need to experiment with wording to get the responses you desire.

This is particularly useful if you want to modify the way the bot responds in certain situations e.g.

_"Always ask for a reason or feedback when the user asks to cancel"_

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the guidance you provide conflict with the AI agent's core instructions, they may be ignored.
{% endhint %}
