* All API requests require an `ID` and `API Key`, these can be found within the Dashboard > Channels > API access (incl/ Zapier).
* Authentication is handled via the API's request body fields, not via any headers
* Remember to set the header for `Content-Type: application/json` (this is the only header needed)
* All API requests are `POST` methods
