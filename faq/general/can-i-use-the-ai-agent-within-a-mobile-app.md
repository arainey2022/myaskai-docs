# ğŸ“± Can I use the AI agent within a mobile app?

While we do not have a mobile SDK for our AI agent, there are several ways you can still use your AI agent if you have a mobile app:

* Use your AI agent via our[ Intercom integration](../../features/channels/intercom/)
* Use your AI agent via our [Zendesk Messaging integration](../../features/channels/zendesk/zendesk-messaging.md)
* Use your AI agent via our [HubSpot integration](../../features/channels/hubspot.md)
* Submit tickets via your app to [Zendesk tickets](../../features/channels/zendesk/zendesk-tickets.md) where our AI agent will answer
* Submit emails via your app to [our AI email assistant](../../features/email-assistant.md)

If you have any questions or need any assistance getting any of these set up, just get in touch with us via our chat.
