# 🤔 Which messages will my AI agent respond to?

#### Will my AI agent reply to images that are sent?&#x20;

Currently your AI agent will not be able to see the images that are sent to it.&#x20;

Instead it will respond with a message saying, "Sorry I can't view images or attachments yet. Please type your question to me."&#x20;

The user will still be able to continue the conversation as long as they can describe the issue that they have in the image.&#x20;

We do expect to be able to respond to image messages in the near future. Watch this space.

#### Is my AI agent able to reply or see attachments in a conversational ticket?

Currently your AI agent will not be able to see the attachment or files that are included in the conversation or ticket.&#x20;

Therefore it will respond with a message saying "Sorry I can't view images or attachments yet, please type your question to me."

The user will be able to continue their conversation as long as they can describe what is in the attachment.&#x20;

We do expect to be able to respond to tickets and conversations that contain attachments in the near future.
