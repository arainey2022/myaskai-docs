# âœ… How can I test the accuracy of my AI agent's answers?

The best way to validate, verify or test the accuracy of your AI agent's answers/responses is to try it out by adding your knowledge and then asking questions in your Dashboard.

Take a set of questions or tickets that have been provided to your support before (we'd recommend 50-150) and then enter them and see how your AI support agent responds.

If you share these questions via a spreadsheet with us (via live chat), we can also run them as a "batch" for you and share the results for you to review.

Another, if you are using our integrations for [Intercom](../../features/channels/intercom/), [Zendesk](../../features/channels/zendesk/zendesk-tickets.md) or [HubSpot](../../features/channels/hubspot/) are to use "Note" or "Comment" replies within those tools so you can see how the AI would respond without it responding directly to a customer.
