# ðŸ’­ Does the AI agent have memory?

Yes, your AI agent will remember conversations and tickets as they progress, so it will be able to answer and refer back to parts of the previous conversation.

What it doesn't have is memory across different tickets/conversations i.e. it doesn't have memory of the customer or user themselves, so it won't take into consideration other tickets they are involved in.&#x20;
