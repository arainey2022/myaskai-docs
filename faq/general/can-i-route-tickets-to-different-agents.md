# Can I route tickets to different agents?

Ticket routing will depend on your support platform being used but can be done in a few different ways:

#### For routing prior to handover e.g. triage

In Zendesk you can use our [Ticket tagging](../../features/channels/zendesk/zendesk-tagging.md) feature in combination with Zendesk triggers to route conversations to either your AI agent or human agents. This will allow you to have more control over which tickets your AI agent is handling.

If you require this feature for Intercom, get in touch with us via our live chat.

#### For routing post-handover e.g. if the AI agent can't resolve a ticket or conversation

If your AI agent can't resolve a conversation in one of our native integrations (Zendesk, Intercom, HubSpot, Freshdesk, Freshchat) then it will either automatically or offer a handover to a person to the user or customer.

When the handover is initiated, a tag or message will be applied to the conversation or ticket identifying it as requiring human assistance.

These tags or messages can then be used in the respective support platforms to initiate triggers, workflows or chatflows to route to specific teams or agents.
