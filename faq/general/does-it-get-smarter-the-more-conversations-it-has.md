# ðŸ¤“ Does it get smarter the more conversations it has?

The only information or training your AI agent has is based on the content or knowledge you upload to it.

It doesn't learn from individual past or historic conversations.

The reason for this is twofold:

1. It is very hard to validate and ensure that the responses given by your agents are accurate and these can change over time.
2. It is much harder to maintain and ensure your AI's knowledge is managed appropriately.&#x20;

You can however improve its training and answer quality by using our [Insights](../../features/insights/) to identify common questions, adding [Custom answers](../../features/improve-+-custom-answers/) to address unanswerable questions and uploading more knowledge to your agent to ensure it can answer in the future.&#x20;
