# 🛑 Do you have any rate limits for conversations for your AI agent?

Our AI agents scale with your usage, so they can process as many concurrent tickets as you receive.

We have clients who process over 100,000 tickets per month without issue.

If you still have concerns about rate limits, just ask to "speak to a person" in our chat.

### How many concurrent conversations can the AI handle?

Each conversation is handled independently and in parallel to the other, we have some customers with hundreds of concurrent conversations and thousands across the entire platform, so we have no issue with scaling and handling multiple conversations for you at once.
