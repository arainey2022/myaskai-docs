# 🎟️ Can I train it initially on my historic tickets?

If you have little in the way of help docs but a backlog of historic tickets your agents have responded to we may be able to help.

We can offer initial training on historic tickets if you are using one of the following helpdesk platforms:

* Intercom
* Freshdesk
* Zendesk

We do not currently offer initial historic training on tickets for HubSpot, Gorgias or emails (including Gmail).&#x20;

To get this set up, ask to "Talk to a person" in our live chat.
