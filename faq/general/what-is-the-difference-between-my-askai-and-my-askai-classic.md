# ⚖️ What is the difference between My AskAI and My AskAI Classic?

### TL;DR

If you are looking for the TL;DR, here it is:&#x20;

If you want a stunning AI support chatbot widget for your site that'll give you insights of how to better build your product and business, you want our new Customer Support product, for everything else, there's Classic.

### **My paid classic account is not being recognized in the new dashboard, what do I do?**

Our Classic and Customer Support products are separate subscriptions, you can continue to use your Classic subscription by choosing "My AskAI Classic" in the Customer Support product menu, above "Account Settings".\

If you would like to switch your Classic subscription to the Customer Support product, let us know at team@myaskai.com and we can move you over.
