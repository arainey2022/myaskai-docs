  "Hallucinations" i.e. making things up is a big problem with AI, but you don't
  have to worry about it with AskAI.

# ðŸ‘ƒ Will it make things up?

My AskAI uses OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT to answer your questions, based on the content thatâ€™s similar to your question.

By default we set My AskAI up so it will only answer questions based on the content you upload, it will not answer any questions where the answer is not contained within the content. This is why you sometimes get an "I'm sorry, I don't know" answer.

This is for 2 reasons:

1. If it had â€˜widerâ€™ ChatGPT knowledge then there would be no way to verify the accuracy of the responses
2. If it did have this ability then users of your My AskAI would essentially just have a free way to access ChatGPT through your My AskAI!

While we train our model to ensure your My AskAI only answers questions truthfully and in a factually accurate manner, however, no service is 100% accurate and we (or anyone else) are unable to make it so and so we do not take any responsibility for the consequences of actions you take based on the results you get from your My AskAI, you use the responses at your own risk.
