# ðŸ§ª How can I test my AI agent without it responding to customers?

It can be pretty daunting 'turning on' AI for the first time for your support.

So we give you a bunch of ways to ease your team in and ensure you minimize the chance of a bad experience.

Here's how:

1. Whenever you connect your AI agent to your [existing support tools](../../features/channels/), by default, it will only ever reply using an 'internal' mode e.g. Internal Notes or Comments. \
   This ensures you can review responses and make sure you are comfortable with them before switching to 'Direct' replies to customers.
2. If you don't even want to connect your AI to your existing support platform yet, you can install our [**Chrome Extension**](../../features/channels/chrome-extension.md), this will then only work in your browser, not anyone else in your team, so you can see again how it works and what answers it gives before going to the next stage.

If you want to understand further how your AI is answering and what knowledge it is using to answer, you can go to **Improve > Inspect & Logs** and search for the conversation by text, email or ticket ID and then see exactly why it answered the way it did (and correct it if you need to).

If there is anything else preventing your from going live with direct replies, message us on our live chat and ask to "Talk to a person".
