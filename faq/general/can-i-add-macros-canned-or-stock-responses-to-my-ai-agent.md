### Can I add macros, canned or stock responses, as a knowledge source?

Most customer support platforms offer the ability to create "macros", canned responses or stock responses.

If you use these often, you may want to add them as a knowledge source to your AI agent to help improve responses.

To do this, there are a few options:

1. If you are using Zendesk, and have connected your Zendesk account, we will import your Zendesk Macros as [Custom Answers](../../features/improve-+-custom-answers/#custom-answers) automatically.
2. If you want the AI to use the responses verbatim (exactly as written), then you should add them as [Custom Answers](../../features/improve-+-custom-answers/#how-do-i-create-a-custom-answer).
3. If you want the AI to just refer to them as another knowledge source, and you don't need the responses to be exactly as written, then you can create a two-column spreadsheet with column headers: "Question" and "Answer" with the macros underneath. \
   \
   You can then add this as a knowledge source either by uploading directly as a file, or (more efficiently) by adding as a synced Google Sheet or Excel sheet with our [Connections](../../features/connections/).

If you have a large number of macros that need to be added, get in touch with us via our chat and we will help you to import them from your existing platform.

### How can I export my macros, canned or stock responses from my existing tool?
