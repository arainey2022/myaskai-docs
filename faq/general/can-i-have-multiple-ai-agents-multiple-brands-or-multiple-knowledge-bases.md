### Can I have multiple AI agents?

You can only have 1 AI agent (brand) per account.

We do offer agency pricing if you require 5 or more AI agents, get in touch via chat to learn more.

### Do you support multiple-brands through one AI agent?

However, we can accommodate multibrand set-ups where you use a single widget e.g. Zendesk, HubSpot, Freshchat, Intercom, or Freshdesk to address queries from different user bases.

Get in touch with us via our chat to learn more about how to set this up.

### Can you support multiple knowledgebases for separate products in a single AI agent?

We are able to support multiple knowledgebases for separate products, get in touch with us via chat to learn more about this.
