# 🧠 Does the AI agent use the ticket or conversation history when responding?

Your AI agent will use previous messages within the same ticket or conversation in order to provide context for its answers.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your AI agent will not use context from other tickets or conversations with that user, only the current ticket or conversation history.
{% endhint %}

If the conversation or ticket period exceeds an hour then the "memory" is reset.

If the conversation or ticket thread exceeds 6 user messages then earlier information may not be retained as accurately.&#x20;

On average, across all clients we see conversation and ticket depths are significantly shorter than this.

If this is an issue for your use case, get in touch with us by asking to "Talk to a person" in our chat.&#x20;

### Does the AI agent have memory?

Yes, your AI agent will remember conversations and tickets as they progress, so it will be able to answer and refer back to parts of the previous conversation.

What it doesn't have is memory across different tickets/conversations, so it won't take into consideration other tickets they are involved in.&#x20;
