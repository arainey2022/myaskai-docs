# ðŸ¥« How do you manage spam tickets, chats or conversations?

For most businesses, spam tickets, chat and conversations are less than 0.1% of their overall support traffic.

In general, we rely on the spam identification and filtering of the individual help desk platforms themselves (e.g. Zendesk, Intercom, Freshdesk, HubSpot and Gorgias) to block this traffic before it reaches your AI agent.

If you have found that you have either been "attacked" or have a meaningful amount of spam then get in touch with us and we can refund you your spam credits.
