# Your content

### Where is information stored?

Content (webpages) you upload are securely stored with [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) once they've been processed by OpenAI (who don’t store them or anything shared via API (except for a 30-day abuse monitoring period) with them - see here for more: [https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies)).&#x20;

We use Qdrant as our “vector database”, this is where the chunks of text are stored along with their corresponding “vectors”.

### Where are your servers located?

Our servers are in the US and EU (mainly US) - Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and located in The Dalles, Oregon, USA (us-west1-gcp).
