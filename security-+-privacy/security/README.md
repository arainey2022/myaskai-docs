# üîê Security

### How secure is My AskAI? (TLDR)

Yes, to keep your data secure (and cover the main things we get asked about):

* We automatically delete your files after they‚Äôve been added to your AI support agent (uploaded to OpenAI), unless you explicitly tell us not to
* All uploaded content is stored in isolated containers
* All data is encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit
* Your data is never used for any reason other than servicing API calls or customer support at your request only
* Your uploaded (embedded) content (vectors) and reference content (text, author, links, etc.) are stored and encrypted on Qdrant, which is run on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and located in The Dalles, Oregon, USA (us-west1-gcp).&#x20;
