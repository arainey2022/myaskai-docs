  There are a number of options for you if you are looking for On-Premise
  capabilities for My AskAI.
---

# On-Premise

We can provide a dedicated vector database instance for your company (this is where all of the text uploaded to My AskAI is stored) and use your company's dedicated OpenAI key, this is only available to our [Enterprise](https://forms.gle/5iFksHJENiwszgcY9) customers.&#x20;

This ensures you own the data storage infrastructure and that your data is almost entirely flowing through services you are the owner of.&#x20;

If you are interested in a [full white-label solution on your own premises](../../account-management/reselling-+-whitelabelling.md), please get in touch via chat.
