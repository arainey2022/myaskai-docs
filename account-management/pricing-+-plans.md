When you sign up to My AskAI you begin a 30-day free trial that allows you to try out all features of your AI support agent without having to provide credit card details.&#x20;

### Do you have a free demo?

You can sign up to test the product out for free for 30 days.

We can also extend trials on a case-by-case basis, if required.

### Do you have a lifetime subscription or plan?

We do not, and never have had lifetime subscriptions for My AskAI, there are however products with similar names which do have lifetime subscriptions so it would be worth checking if you are not trying to use one of those first.

### What is a "Conversation" and what are "AI responses"?

Because we have a number of integrations and channels that all work in different ways, we had to come up with a pricing model that works across them all.

The simplest way to understand this is:

* If you are using our own (My AskAI) widget, then a 'conversation' is any number of questions or AI responses within a 1 hour period from one user, without them refreshing their chat session
* If you are using any of our integrations/partners (e.g. Zendesk, HubSpot, Intercom, Freshdesk, Freshchat or Gorgias) - then a chat 'conversation' is every 2.5 AI responses. We came up with this number from looking at the average length of conversations we saw people having with AI agents.\
  This means, that each time you get an AI reply/response from our AI agent it counts as 0.4 of a conversation.\
  If however you are using My AskAI for ticket/email replies, then the first AI reply counts as 1 "conversation", and subsequent responses are 0.4 of a conversation.\
  Equating this to 'tickets', each response to a ticket question will count as 0.4 of a conversation, so if a ticket is 10 user messages long, this will count as 4.6 conversations. If it is only one message, it will be 1 conversation. &#x20;
