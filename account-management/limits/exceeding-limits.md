# Exceeding limits

### What happens if I go over or exceed my monthly conversation quota, limit or allowance?

#### Pro Plan

If you are on a Pro plan, then you have "Flex" turned pricing turned on (this cannot be turned off).&#x20;

Flex allows your AI agent to continue responding when you go beyond your conversation limits, each conversation beyond your account limit is charged at $0.10 and is charged in the next month's invoice or on cancellation.

### Can I disable Flex?

You cannot disable flex pricing.

### Can I limit the number of conversations asked by employees?

There are no ways to currently limit conversations from employees, if this is an issue for you, please contact us via chat.
