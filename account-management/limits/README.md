# ðŸ§± Limits

### What are my token limits?

Luckily you donâ€™t need to worry about all that, leave that to us. There are no training content limits in terms of pages or words on any of our paid plans.

The only limits you need to know about are your conversation limits.

Conversation limits are at an overall account level, i.e. they are conversations with the AI agent, they are not per visitor.

| Plan       | Number of conversations                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Essentials | 200                                         |
| Pro        | 1,000 + $0.10 per conversation beyond limit |
| Enterprise | Prices upon request                         |

### Question character limits

Your questions can be up to 400 characters in length.
