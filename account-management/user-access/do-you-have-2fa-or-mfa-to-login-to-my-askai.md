# 🔏 Do you have 2FA or MFA to login to My AskAI?

We currently do not offer 2FA or MFA to login to My AskAI, however you can sign up with a work Gmail address (not a personal Gmail) and utilize their authentication to achieve this.

If you require 2FA/MFA and are [interested in our Enterprise plans](../../start-here/create-your-ai-customer-service-agent.md), get in touch by asking to "talk to a person".
