# Tax

### What taxes do I have to pay?

AskAI Ltd is based in the UK, we, therefore, have to charge UK sales tax (VAT) at a rate of 20% to any B2C (Consumer) user globally and any B2B users based in the UK.

If you are a business outside of the UK, you may not have to pay this sales tax (this will depend on your location).

### How do I ensure I am paying the correct tax?

#### At sign up

To ensure your tax is calculated correctly on your subscription ensure you provide your Tax ID at the checkout screen on sign up.

#### If you've already signed up

If you are already a My AskAI user and are being charged tax then you can update your Tax ID like this:

1. Go to _**Account settings > Billing**_ then click on _"Manage subscription on Stripe"._
2. Click "Update information"
