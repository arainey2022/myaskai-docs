# Change plan

To change your plan, downgrade, upgrade, add or remove add-ons like team seats and branding removal, go to _**Account settings > Billing**_ then click on _"Manage subscription on Stripe"._

Stripe (our payments processor) will then open and you will be able to Update your plan details from there.&#x20;
