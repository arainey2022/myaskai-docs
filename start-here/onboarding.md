  Pretty much the first question everyone has before signing up to My AskAI, is
  "how long will this take to set up?", so let me explain what our onboarding
  looks like.

# ⛵ Onboarding

### What do I need before getting starting?

All you need to get started is:

* A company email address
* Admin access to your helpdesk (so you can set up your AI agent integration)

### What specialist skills do I need to get started?

You don't need any specialist skills to get started - you don't need to be a developer or an AI whiz.&#x20;

You'll only need to get a developer involved if/when you start wanting to connect [User Data](../features/user-data-api/) or set up [Tools](../features/ai-actions-tools.md) for your AI agent.

### How quickly will I have my AI agent replying?

You can [sign up on our homepage](https://myaskai.com/) today, no sales calls or demos required (unless you want one).

Once you sign up, you will [go through a simple onboarding set-up](create-your-ai-customer-service-agent.md) where you'll:

* [Connect](../features/connections/) your existing help center, store or website (one-click connection or enter a URL)
* Configure any [guidance](../features/improve/guidance.md) you want to use (or leave as is and update later)
* Connect your respective helpdesk
* Review your test replies
* That's it - your AI agent will be replying to tickets in "notes mode" (i.e. not directly to customers)

There is obviously much more you can do to improve this setup, but principally when you have completed the above onboarding (\~5-10 mins) you will be getting AI replies.

### What will the first 90 days of using my AI agent look like?

Here's what a typical first 90 days looks like for a new customer:

#### **Day 1 (15-30 mins)**

* Connect AI agent to help center and helpdesk platform and start receiving "note" replies to tickets.
* Add [guidance](../features/improve/guidance.md) to match your company's tone of voice/brand guidelines
* Set up AI auto-tagging (where available)&#x20;
* [Invite team members](../features/team-access.md) to Dashboard and define roles

#### Day 2-7 (15-30 mins/day)

* Review AI agent replies and responses (in helpdesk and in My AskAI [Inspect & Logs](../features/improve/inspect-and-logs.md)):
  * Identify obvious knowledge gaps, update articles or add [custom answers](../features/improve/custom-answers.md)
  * Update guidance for tone, scenario-based rules
  * Identify areas where [User Data](../features/user-data-api/), [Tools](../features/ai-actions-tools.md) or [Tasks](../features/tasks/) may have an impact
  * Review tag categories you don't want to use AI for
* Get a benchmark "AI resolution" rate for the AI agent
* Get all agents to Install [Chrome Extension copilot](../features/channels/chrome-extension.md)

#### Day 8-14 (15 mins/day)

* Turn on direct replies to customers or users
* Customize any setup or rules in helpdesk platform to fit your business e.g. handover assignments, tagging triage etc

#### Day 15 - 29 (15-45 mins/day)

* Monitor direct replies
* Review [Insights](../features/insights/) and sort by lower AI resolution and CSAT topics to identify areas for improvement
* Review a sample of AI agent replies and responses (in helpdesk and in My AskAI [Inspect & Logs](../features/improve/inspect-and-logs.md)):
  * Identify obvious knowledge gaps, update articles or add [custom answers](../features/improve/custom-answers.md)
  * Update guidance for tone, scenario-based rules
  * Identify areas where [User Data](../features/user-data-api/), [Tools](../features/ai-actions-tools.md) or [Tasks](../features/tasks/) may have an impact
* Create multi-step [Tasks](../features/tasks/) (excluding tools) for highest impact processes

#### Day 30 (30 seconds)

* Add credit card and upgrade to paid account

#### Day 31 - 60 (15-45 mins/day, 1-3hrs one-off for APIs)

* Create and connect APIs to provide dynamic, personalized data to AI agent via [User Data API](../features/user-data-api/)
* Daily/weekly QA review of a sample of AI agent replies
  * Review and approve knowledge gap suggestions
  * Tweak guidance
  * Look for low AI resolution or CSAT topics

#### Day 61 - 90 (15-45 mins/day, 1-3hrs one-off for APIs)

* Create APIs to allow AI agent to interact with back-end databases via [Tools](../features/ai-actions-tools.md)
* Daily/weekly QA review of a sample of AI agent replies
  * Review and approve knowledge gap suggestions
  * Tweak guidance
  * Look for low AI resolution or CSAT topics
* Create multi-step [Tasks](../features/tasks/) (including tools) for highest impact processes

### How do I test my AI agent's responses?

For more on testing your AI agent's responses, [read here](testing.md).

### What support do I have during onboarding?

The support you have during onboarding will depend on your plan type:

* **Pro plan** users are largely 'self-serve' but can contact support via our live chat if they need help getting their helpdesk connected or they identify a bug.
* **Enterprise plan** users will have white-glove onboarding support, whereby they can invite a member of our team to have access to their helpdesk platform and have their AI agent set up for them over a call. \
  They will also have access to our team via Slack for any questions they have during the onboarding process or on a daily basis thereafter.&#x20;
