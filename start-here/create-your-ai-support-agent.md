# 🏗️ Create your AI support agent

### **Step 1 - Choose your support tool and enter your email (<10 seconds)**

To get started, click "Create your free AI agent", choose your current support tool or live chat provider, then click to continue with Google or Sign up (you must use a work email).

### **Step 2 - Tell us a bit about your current set-up**

We'll ask you a few quick questions that will help tailor your set-up experience like:

* How many support tickets do you receive each month?
* How did you hear about us?
* Where are your help docs?

### **Step 3 - Add knowledge to train your AI agent (<30 seconds)**

Now it's time to add some knowledge to your AI agent so it can answer questions about your business.

You can either [Connect a Help Center](../features/connections/) (like Intercom, Zendesk, Freshdesk or Gitbook) or add help articles website and we'll add all of your pages.

If you have added a website it can take up to an hour to process (for us to find all of your webpages), you will get an email when this has been completed.

Once you have added your content, click "**Review AI answers**" on the right-hand side of the screen.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have Help Center content available on one of our connections we recommend you add it rather than as a website as you will get better quality answers and it will be updated more frequently.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can add content from other sources, such as Google Drive, Notion and more once you have performed your initial set-up.
{% endhint %}

### Step 4 - Review AI answers (<2 minutes)

It's time to see how your AI agent will answer some questions about your business.

We automatically generate questions so you can see how your AI agent responds under different circumstances, for example: general questions, frustrated customers, customers wanting to speak to a human agent.

Click through these questions to review them, and once you have done so you will see a "**Have a conversation**" button activate on the right-hand side of your screen.

### Step 5 - Have a conversation (<60 seconds or however long you want!)

Your AI support agent has now been trained on your knowledge and is ready to answer your questions.

You can also see what the human handover feature looks like too, just click the "Talk to a person" button or type "Talk to a person".

Once you have asked 3 questions you will see the "**Share with your team**" button activate.

### Step 6 - Share with your team (<30 seconds)

Most customers want to try their AI agent out in a safe way before turning it on for customers.

So this is your opportunity to share your AI agent with your team so they can test it out, and also set it up as a [Chrome Extension](../features/channels/chrome-extension.md) so you can use it wherever you are working and see how it does.

Once you have done this click "**Unlock your AI agent dashboard**".

### Step 7 (last one) - Try it all out!

You now have 30 days to fully test out all the features of the My AskAI platform, test your AI agent responses and add to your site or [integrate with your existing tools](../features/channels/), for free! &#x20;
