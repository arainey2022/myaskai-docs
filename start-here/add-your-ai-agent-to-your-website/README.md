# âž• Add your AI agent to your website

{% hint style="success" %}
You can also add your AI agent to your site using our native integrations with [Intercom](../../features/channels/intercom/), [Zendesk](../../features/channels/zendesk/zendesk-messaging.md) and [HubSpot](../../features/channels/hubspot.md) in which case you don't need to embed any code into your site, you just need to use the apps from the respective marketplaces.
{% endhint %}

See how our AI agents are being used to deflect tickets and bring down response times at Zeffy:

### Step 1 - Navigate to the Channels page

Head on over to your [Dashboard](https://www.myaskai.com/dashboard) then click _**Channels**_ in your side menu&#x20;

### Step 2 - Choose how you want to add to your site

You can either add your AI agent as a widget (in the bottom corner of your screen) or as an embed (in the page itself). You can also switch between the floating bubble and the in-page chat at a later date by clicking "Change type"

### Step 3 - Copy the code snippet and add it to your site

Once you have selected your widget, all you need to do is click on the copy icon in the black box showing the code snippet and then paste it into the \<head> section of the HTML on your site.

Most website builders will allow you to do this in a custom code section but if you have any issues adding it just get in touch with us via our chat and we'll help you out.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are choosing to embed within the page itself, instead of as a chat widget in the corner of your page then you will have to paste 2 code snippets - 1 in the \<head> section and 1 in the \<body> section (where you want the chat to live!)
{% endhint %}

For site-builder specific instructions, refer below:

{% content-ref url="wordpress.md" %}
[wordpress.md](wordpress.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="shopify.md" %}
[shopify.md](shopify.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="zendesk.md" %}
[zendesk.md](zendesk.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Step 4 (optional) - Advanced settings

There are a few settings you can tweak on each mode, here's what you can change:

#### Chat widget

* **Auto-open**: You can make your AI chatbot auto-open for new users on a page, and also select the length of time it will open after, it will only do this for 1st-time visitors.
* **Pulsate**: Your chat icon will "pulse" in the bottom corner of the page for 10 seconds (or until opened), to draw more attention to it, again this will only be for 1st-time visitors.
* **Animated chat icon**: Your chat icon will have a subtle animation, again to draw attention to it for the user.
* **Chat icon color**: Edit the color of the chat icon to match your brand, just choose your HEX code.&#x20;

#### Chat embed

* **Live chat widget visibility**: You can choose if you want us to hide your live chat widget by default, until someone asks to talk to a person with your AI agent.
