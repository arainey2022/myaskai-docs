# 🏗️ Create your AI customer service agent

### **Step 1 - Choose your support tool and enter your email (<10 seconds)**

To get started and create an account, click "Create AI agent" on our homepage, choose your current helpdesk, then click to continue with Google or Sign up (you must use a work email).

### **Step 2 - Tell us a bit about your current set-up**

We'll ask you a few quick questions that will help tailor your set-up experience like:

* How many support tickets do you receive each month?
* How did you hear about us?

### **Step 3 - Add knowledge to train your AI agent (<30 seconds)**

Now it's time to add some knowledge to your AI agent so it can answer questions about your business.

You can either [Connect a Help Center](../features/connections/) (like Intercom, Zendesk, Freshdesk or Gitbook) or add help articles from your website and we'll add all of your pages.

If you have added a website it can take up to an hour to process (for us to find all of your webpages), you will get an email when this has been completed.

Once you have added your content, click "**Continue to guidance**" at the bottom of the screen.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have Help Center content available on one of our connections we recommend you add it rather than as a website as you will get better quality answers and it will be updated more frequently.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can add content from other sources, such as Google Drive, Notion and more once you have performed your initial set-up.
{% endhint %}

### Step 4 - Customize AI agent replies with guidance (optional - 1-2 mins)

This is your first opportunity to adjust how you want your AI agent to reply.

You can give guidance to change the tone of voice, formality, define when it should ask follow-up questions and when it should escalate to a person.

You can read more on [Guidance](../features/improve/guidance.md) here.

### Step 5 - Connect to your helpdesk (1 - 2 mins)

Now you have added knowledge it is time to add your AI customer service agent to your helpdesk.

But don't worry, it will only generate "internal note" replies that your human agents will see, not your customers.

Each helpdesk connection works slightly differently, but in short, this will involve you signing-in to your helpdesk via My AskAI, it doesn't require any technical know-how, but you will usually need to have admin privileges.

[Read more on helpdesk connections here](../features/channels/).

### Step 6 - Review your AI agent's test question (2 - 5 mins)

It's time to see how your AI agent will answer some questions about your business.

We automatically take a sample of your historic tickets and put them through our AI agent so you can see how your AI agent would have responded.

Review the responses, and once you have done click through to the next screen.

### Step 7 - Share with your team (<30 seconds)

Most customers want to try their AI agent out in a safe way before turning it on for customers.

So this is your opportunity to share your AI agent with your team so they can test it out, and also set it up as a [Chrome Extension](../features/channels/chrome-extension.md) so you can use it wherever you are working and see how it does.

Once you have done this click "**Unlock your AI agent dashboard**".

### Step 8 (last one) - Try it all out!

You now have 30 days to fully test out all the features of the My AskAI platform, test your AI agent responses and add to your site or [integrate with your existing tools](../features/channels/), for free! &#x20;

If you want to know now what a typical first 30 days looks like, [take a look at this](onboarding.md#what-will-the-first-30-days-of-using-my-ai-agent-look-like).
