# ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What is an AI Customer Support Agent?

Your AI agent is your 1st line of defence for customer support. When added to your site it'll answer all your customers' or visitors' queries using the information you have on your website and help documentation. It can generally answer up to 75% of users' questions about your product.

Think of it as your own custom [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) that knows only your data and that you can add to your website. It‚Äôll only answer questions based on the content that you upload (unlike ChatGPT, which tends to make things up).&#x20;

When it answers, it will provide links to the help documents or knowledge articles on your sites from which the answer came from so they can read more if they choose.

If the AI can't answer the question, or if at any time the customer wants to speak to a person, they can too by using our [human handover](../../features/human-handover.md) feature.

All of the conversations held with the AI are recorded and analysed for [insights](../../features/insights/) that you can use to improve your product and services.

But sometimes it is easier to just take the plunge and try it out yourself:
