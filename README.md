# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My AskAI

Hi, and welcome to My AskAI!

After releasing My AskAI in early 2023 we very quickly found one of the most valuable activities for us day-to-day was talking to our customers through customer support - we'd find out what they wanted us to build, the feedback they had on our designs and the bugs they were finding!

But as our user base scaled, and as a lean team, we started to find it more difficult to manage and we didn't want to hire a team of customer support agents as so much data can get lost in those conversations.

So we had an idea - find a way to turn our own AI agents into the ultimate customer support agent.

One that:&#x20;

* Could solve most user issues but that would still give customers a way to speak to a person if they needed
* Was super simple to set-up and use and that you wouldn't be embarrassed to have front and center on your site&#x20;
* (For us, most importantly) took all of the conversations users were having and distilled them into actionable insights: feedback, issues, bugs, feature requests, and questions - all so you can use them to make your product and experience better, and better.

So that's what we are building with My AskAI.

We believe in continual improvement and development of our product and once you sign up you'll start to see this very quickly... ([check out our changelog](https://feedback.myaskai.com/changelog) to see everything we've added so far if you don't believe us!), but we also believe in supporting our users along the way and trying to go the extra mile for them (as our [case studies](https://myaskai.com/blog/tags/case-study-posts) will demonstrate).
