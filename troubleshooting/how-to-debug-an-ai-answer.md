# 🐞 How to debug an AI answer

### Why might I not get an answer I expect from my AI agent?

Your AI agent can only answer based on the information you provide and the instructions you give to it.

It can't (obviously) read your mind, and will take the content you provide to it literally, it won't make assumptions or "read between the lines".

If you haven't said something explicitly or if you have used ambiguous language, you may not get the result you expect.

You also may have provided it with conflicting instructions or knowledge, and therefore it won't know which instruction or piece of knowledge it can rely on.

But how can you _know_ how it came up with its answer?

### How can I see how it came up with its answer?

To understand why your AI agent answered in the way that it did, you can use our "Inspect answer" feature, here's how:

1. Locate your ticket in the My AskAI dashboard either by: searching for the ticket ID in **Inspect & Logs**, or by clicking the Internal note in your respective helpdesk platform.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip:** If you can't locate the ticket or remember where you saw it, if you ask the same question in the preview widget e.g. on the Guidance page, you can then see that new conversation in the Inspect & Logs screen in a few seconds.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

2. Click the ticket and the Inspect side panel will open for that ticket or conversation.
3. Click on "Inspect answer" and ask your question.
4. The AI inspector will then explain why the answer was given in the way that it was, and will share details of:\
   \
   \- A summary of the answer.\
   \- Any supporting quotes or knowledge sources used for that answer (e.g. custom answers, help center articles, webpages etc).\
   \- Any guidance that was applied to that answer.\
   \- Any user data, tool or task that was used to create the answer.
5. If, after inspecting the answer you still don't understand the response or think it may be incorrect, you cam get in touch with us via our chat widget and ask to "Talk to a person".&#x20;
