# ðŸ’³ I can't see any billing information for my account?

If you are unable to see billing information or details for your account, it is likely because you aren't the owner of the account.

You will need to either logout and then login as the owner of the account, or contact the account owner to provide you with the billing information for the account.&#x20;

You can find the account owner by going to Account Settings and looking under "Team access".
