  You can generally expect response times from My AskAI to be just a few seconds
  however there are rare occasions when this is not the case.

# 🐢 Slow responses



Response times can vary based on API response times and also by the size of the answer being returned.&#x20;

The longer and more detailed the answer being given the longer it will take to produce.

Unlike some other (faster) AI agents, our AI agents have a number of guardrail and quality assurance steps in place before responding.

This can mean that a single question may go through 10+ processes before a response is returned.

This ensures the highest quality answers for your users and customers. &#x20;

Also, bear in mind that answer speeds are always improving with the pace of AI development, so if they aren't quick enough now, give it a month or 2!

### What do you/can I do to try and make responses "feel" faster?

Depending on your helpdesk integration your AI agent can display something different while the user is awaiting a reply, for example on:

* Zendesk Messaging: an animated "..." icon will be displayed
* Intercom chat: a "just thinking..." message will be displayed ([this can be turned off if required](../features/channels/intercom/#can-i-turn-off-the-just-thinking...-or-just-having-a-think...-messages-in-intercom))&#x20;
* HubSpot chat: a "just thinking..." message will be displayed ([this can be turned off if required](../features/channels/hubspot/#can-i-turn-off-the-just-thinking...-or-just-having-a-think...-messages-in-hubspot))
* Freshchat: a "just thinking..." message will be displayed ([this can be turned off if required](../features/channels/freshchat/#can-i-turn-off-the-just-thinking...-or-just-having-a-think...-messages-in-freshchat))
* Gorgias chat: a "just thinking..." message will be displayed ([this can be turned off if required](../features/channels/gorgias.md#can-i-turn-off-the-just-thinking...-or-just-having-a-think...-messages-in-gorgias))
