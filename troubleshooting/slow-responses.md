  You can generally expect response times from My AskAI to be just a few seconds
  however there are rare occasions when this is not the case.

# üê¢ Slow responses



Response times can vary based on OpenAI‚Äôs API response times and also by the size of the answer being returned. The longer and more detailed the answer being given the longer it will take to produce.&#x20;

Finally, answer speeds are always improving with the pace of AI development, so if they aren't quick enough now, give it a month or 2!
