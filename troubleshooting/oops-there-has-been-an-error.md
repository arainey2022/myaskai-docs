If you see the response "oops there has been an error" then first check that you are using the correct "Mode" for your AI support agent, if you have uploaded a file or used a connector, by default that information is private, and so you will need to toggle your AI support agent to ["Public + Private" mode](../features/private-internal-mode.md) to get responses from it.&#x20;

Also check that you have content added to your AI support agent, if it doesn't have anything to answer with, it won't be able to answer!

If this doesn't resolve your issue please get in touch with us via chat.
